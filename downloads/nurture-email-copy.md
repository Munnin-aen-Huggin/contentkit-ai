## Email 2 — Day 2: Value/Credibility

**Subject:** The AI copy mistake 90% of marketers make

**Body:**

Hi {{subscriber.first_name}},

Quick question: when you open a fresh ChatGPT chat and type "write me an Instagram caption," what do you get?

Generic. Robotic. Forgettable.

The problem isn't the AI — it's the prompt.

Most marketers treat AI like a search engine. They ask vague questions and get vague answers. The ones producing scroll-stopping copy do something different: they give the AI a *character brief*.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

Instead of: "Write me an email subject line for my sale."

Try: "You are a direct-response copywriter for a DTC brand targeting millennial women aged 25–34. Write 5 subject lines for a 48-hour flash sale on skincare. Tone: urgent but not desperate. Use curiosity, specificity, and one emotional trigger. Reference the reader's fear of missing out without using the word 'hurry.'"

The second prompt produces 5 subject lines you'd actually test.

That's the principle behind every prompt in ContentKit — each one is pre-loaded with role, tone, audience, and output format so the AI knows exactly what to produce.

More insights coming in a couple days.

## Email 3 — Day 4: Product Introduction

**Subject:** I built something for marketers who hate staring at blank screens

**Body:**

Hi {{subscriber.first_name}},

After working with dozens of marketing teams, I kept seeing the same bottleneck: smart people spending hours on content that should take minutes.

The AI tools existed. The intention was there. But without the right prompts — the ones that actually get usable output — the tools felt like another thing to wrestle with.

So I built ContentKit AI.

**Here's what it is:**

500+ copy-paste prompts across 8 marketing categories — ads, emails, social media, landing pages, SEO content, brand strategy, product launches, and video scripts. Plus four Notion templates: a 30-day calendar, a 90-day calendar, a brand strategy workspace, and a campaign planner.

**Who it's for:**

Solopreneurs, freelancers, and agency owners who need to produce high-quality marketing content fast — without paying $200/month for copywriting subscriptions.

**How it's different from generic AI prompting:**

Every prompt is pre-engineered with the variables that make AI output actually usable: role, audience specificity, tone parameters, and output format. You fill in your details, paste the prompt, and get professional-grade copy in seconds.

**Starter Kit — $67** (200+ prompts, 30-day calendar):

**Full Kit — $127** (500+ prompts, all 4 Notion templates):

## Email 4 — Day 6: Social Proof/Case Study

**Subject:** How one freelancer cut their content time by 70%

**Body:**

Hi {{subscriber.first_name}},

Let me tell you about Marcus — a freelance marketing consultant serving 8 clients at once.

**Before ContentKit:**
- Spent 12–15 hours/week writing client content
- Delivered one email sequence per client per month at best
- Charged $800/month per client — barely profitable at that volume

**After ContentKit:**
- Produces first drafts in 20–30 minutes using the prompt templates
- Delivers 2–3 email sequences, a full month of social content, and ad copy variations monthly
- Raised rates to $1,400/month per client because the output quality improved

Same clients. Same deliverables scope. 70% less writing time. Significantly higher rates.

The shift wasn't his skill — it was his system.

ContentKit gave him a repeatable process: pick the right category, fill in the client variables, generate multiple options, refine the best one. Each deliverable that used to take 3 hours now takes under an hour.

That's the multiplier effect of good prompts.

If you're still producing content the old way — starting from scratch every time — ContentKit is the upgrade your workflow needs.

## Email 5 — Day 9: Urgency/Final Offer

**Subject:** Last chance: Your AI marketing toolkit is waiting

**Body:**

Hi {{subscriber.first_name}},

This is the last email I'll send about ContentKit AI.

If you've been on the fence, here's the honest case:

Every week you spend producing content the hard way is a week of compounding inefficiency. The gap between marketers who have a system and those who don't keeps growing — because the ones with systems produce more, test more, and improve faster.

ContentKit is that system.

**Starter Kit — $67:**
- 200+ prompts across ads, email, and social media
- 30-day content calendar (Notion-compatible)
- Lifetime access + free updates
- → https://buy.stripe.com/28E3cw0hobVQ66C0j69ws02

**Full Kit — $127 (most popular):**
- 500+ prompts across all 8 marketing categories
- 4 Notion templates (30-day calendar, 90-day calendar, brand strategy workspace, campaign planner)
- Landing page copy prompts, SEO prompts, video scripts, product launch kit
- Everything in Starter, plus everything that scales
- → https://buy.stripe.com/9B69AU3tA8JE8eKaXK9ws03

One-time payment. Instant download. 30-day money-back guarantee — if it doesn't save you time and improve your output, email me for a full refund. No questions asked.

This is the last nudge. You've got the lead magnet. You've seen what well-engineered prompts can do. The next step is up to you.
