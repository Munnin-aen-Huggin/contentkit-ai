# AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Full Kit (500+ Prompts)

## How to Use This Pack

These prompts are engineered to produce specific, usable marketing outputs — not generic drafts you'll throw away. Each prompt specifies a role for the AI, a structural framework (PAS, AIDA, etc.), and clear variables you replace with your own details. The result is copy that actually sounds like it was written for your business.

To use a prompt: copy it, fill in every bracketed variable with your specific information, then paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI writing tool. The more specific your variable inputs, the better your output. Don't leave variables vague — "freelance graphic designer charging $45/hr who works with SaaS startups" will always outperform "designer."

When the output needs refinement, don't start over — append a follow-up instruction like "Make the CTA more urgent" or "Shorten to 3 sentences" or "Rewrite the second paragraph to focus on the fear of missing out." These prompts are starting points for a conversation, not single-shot commands.

## Category 1: Ads (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn)

These prompts cover the full spectrum of paid advertising copy — from Facebook scroll-stopping hooks to Google search headlines to LinkedIn sponsored content.

---

### FB-01: Facebook Ad — PAS Framework (Pain-Agitate-Solution)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when targeting a cold audience who doesn't know your brand. PAS works by identifying a pain point, amplifying the frustration, then positioning your offer as the relief. Best for awareness and consideration campaigns.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a direct-response copywriter specializing in Facebook ads. Write a PAS-framework Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Target audience: [TARGET AUDIENCE — e.g., "freelance graphic designers charging under $50/hr"]. Pain point: [CORE PAIN — e.g., "spending hours on client proposals that never convert"]. Agitate by describing the emotional and financial cost of this problem. Solution: position [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] as the fix. Include a primary text (up to 125 words), a short headline (under 40 characters), and a description (under 30 characters). End with a CTA button label from this list: [Learn More / Shop Now / Sign Up / Get Quote / Download].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "ProposalKit" or "my Canva proposal template pack"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "freelance graphic designers charging under $50/hr"
- [CORE PAIN] — e.g., "spending 3+ hours on proposals that clients ghost"
- [CTA BUTTON] — e.g., "Download"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
Three-part Facebook ad: primary text (pain → agitate → solution, ~100 words), a punchy headline under 40 characters, and a description line under 30 characters. Tone is empathetic but direct.

---

### FB-02: Facebook Ad — AIDA Framework (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for warm audiences who've shown interest in your category but haven't purchased. AIDA moves methodically from grabbing attention to building rational desire to driving action.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a conversion copywriter. Write an AIDA-framework Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. The attention hook must address [ATTENTION HOOK — e.g., a surprising statistic or bold claim]. Interest section: explain what [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] does in one sentence. Desire section: list 3 specific benefits using "you" language. Action: one clear CTA sentence with urgency. Format: primary text (up to 150 words), headline (under 40 characters), and description (under 30 characters).

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit AI prompt pack"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "small business owners running their own social media"
- [ATTENTION HOOK] — e.g., "Most business owners waste 6 hours/week writing captions from scratch"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A four-section Facebook ad (Attention/Interest/Desire/Action) in primary text format (~130 words), plus headline and description. Reads as natural copy, not a formulaic outline.

---

### FB-03: Facebook Ad — Benefit-Driven (Feature → Benefit → Proof)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your product has specific, demonstrable features that translate to clear outcomes. Ideal for product-aware audiences who need to understand value before clicking.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product marketing copywriter. Write a benefit-driven Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. List 3 core features: [FEATURE 1], [FEATURE 2], [FEATURE 3]. For each feature, write: the feature name, the direct benefit to [TARGET AUDIENCE], and one line of social proof or specificity (stat, time saved, result). End with a single CTA sentence. Format: primary text only, under 150 words. Do not use bullet points — write in short punchy paragraphs.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "BrandKit Notion template"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "freelancers onboarding new clients"
- [FEATURE 1/2/3] — e.g., "pre-built brand questionnaire / client portal / invoice tracker"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A flowing paragraph-style Facebook ad (~130 words) that covers three feature-benefit-proof sequences and ends with a clear CTA. No bullet lists — reads like human ad copy.

---

### FB-04: Facebook Retargeting Ad — Abandoned Consideration

**CONTEXT:**
Use for people who visited your sales page or landing page but didn't buy. This audience is warm — they just need a nudge, an objection handled, or a reason to come back now.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a retargeting ad specialist. Write a Facebook retargeting ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting people who visited [LANDING PAGE URL/DESCRIPTION — e.g., "the sales page for my AI prompt pack"] but didn't purchase. Acknowledge that they've seen the product without being creepy. Address the most likely objection: [TOP OBJECTION — e.g., "not sure if it's worth $47"]. Offer a compelling reason to return now: [INCENTIVE — e.g., "limited-time bonus: free email swipe file added to the bundle"]. Primary text under 100 words. Include headline and description.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [LANDING PAGE URL/DESCRIPTION] — e.g., "my prompt pack sales page"
- [TOP OBJECTION] — e.g., "not sure if AI-written copy will sound like me"
- [INCENTIVE] — e.g., "added 50 new prompts this week — same price"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A conversational retargeting ad (~90 words primary text) that acknowledges prior interest, handles one objection, and gives a time-sensitive reason to return. Headline and description included.

---

### FB-05: Facebook Video Ad Script (30 seconds)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when running video ads on Facebook/Instagram. The first 3 seconds determine whether someone keeps watching — this prompt builds that hook first, then delivers the value, then closes.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a video ad scriptwriter. Write a 30-second Facebook/Instagram video ad script for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Structure: Hook (0-3 sec): one sentence that stops the scroll for [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Problem (3-10 sec): state the pain in 1-2 sentences. Solution (10-20 sec): show how [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] solves it — describe what appears on screen. CTA (20-30 sec): tell viewer exactly what to do and why now. Include [VISUAL NOTE] directions in brackets. Tone: [TONE — e.g., "conversational and relatable, not salesy"].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit AI prompts"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "coaches and consultants creating content"
- [TONE] — e.g., "energetic and direct" or "calm and authoritative"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A timestamped 30-second video ad script with on-screen visual notes in brackets, voiceover text, and a clear CTA. Approximately 80-100 spoken words.

---

### FB-06: Facebook Lead Gen Ad — Free Resource Offer

**CONTEXT:**
Use to drive email list signups via Facebook Lead Gen forms. The offer must be clear and specific — vague "free guides" don't convert. This prompt builds copy around a specific lead magnet.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a lead generation copywriter. Write a Facebook Lead Gen ad offering [LEAD MAGNET NAME — e.g., "a free PDF: 5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"]. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Headline must communicate the specific value of the lead magnet in under 40 characters. Primary text (under 125 words): open with the core promise, state who it's for, list 3 specific things they'll get or learn, end with a low-friction CTA ("Grab it free" or "Download now"). Do not use "newsletter" or "subscribe" language.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [LEAD MAGNET NAME] — e.g., "5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "small business owners spending money on freelance copywriters"
- [3 SPECIFIC OUTCOMES] — e.g., "write a homepage headline / draft a launch email / create a week of social posts"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A lead gen ad with headline (under 40 chars), primary text (~110 words), and description line. Tone emphasizes the free value, not the signup act. No spam-trigger language.

---

### FB-07: Facebook Lookalike Audience Ad — Social Proof Driven

**CONTEXT:**
Use for lookalike audience campaigns where the audience doesn't know your brand but is similar to buyers. Social proof (results, numbers, testimonials) builds instant credibility with cold-but-similar audiences.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a social proof copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting a lookalike audience similar to existing customers. Lead with a specific result or testimonial: [SOCIAL PROOF — e.g., "473 marketers used this to cut their content creation time in half"]. Follow with what the product is and who it's for. Include 2 more proof signals (star rating, customer count, specific outcome). End with CTA. Primary text under 125 words, headline under 40 characters.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] — e.g., "312 buyers. 4.9 stars. 'I wrote a month of content in one afternoon.'"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A proof-heavy Facebook ad (~110 words) that leads with credibility, explains the offer clearly, and closes with urgency or social momentum. Headline and description included.

---

### FB-08: Facebook Ad — Urgency/Scarcity (Launch or Sale)

**CONTEXT:**
Use during a product launch window, flash sale, or limited-time offer. Urgency must be specific and believable — "limited time" without a deadline doesn't work.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a launch copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that creates genuine urgency around [DEADLINE/SCARCITY — e.g., "cart closes Friday at midnight" or "price increases from $27 to $47 on March 1"]. Primary text: acknowledge the limited window in the first line, state what they get, state what they lose if they wait, close with CTA. Under 100 words. Include a headline (under 40 chars) that leads with the deadline.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Full Kit"
- [DEADLINE/SCARCITY] — e.g., "launch price of $47 ends Sunday at midnight"
- [WHAT THEY LOSE] — e.g., "price goes up to $97 and the bonus email swipe file disappears"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A ~90-word urgency-driven Facebook ad with deadline in the headline, clear stakes in the body, and a direct CTA. Tone is matter-of-fact, not hype-y.

---

### FB-09: Facebook Ad — Before/After Transformation

**CONTEXT:**
Use for products or services with a clear before/after outcome. Works especially well for productivity tools, courses, templates, and coaching. Visual contrast of states drives desire.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a transformation copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a before/after format. Before state: [BEFORE — e.g., "spending 3 hours writing one email and second-guessing every word"]. After state: [AFTER — e.g., "30-minute email that sounds like you on your best day"]. Bridge: [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] is what gets them from before to after. Include: how it works (one sentence), who it's for, and CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit AI Prompt Pack"
- [BEFORE] — e.g., "posting random content and getting zero engagement"
- [AFTER] — e.g., "publishing a month of strategic content in one afternoon"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A contrast-driven Facebook ad (~110 words) that paints the before state vividly, makes the after state aspirational, and positions the product as the bridge. Headline and description included.

---

### FB-10: Facebook Ad — Question Hook (Curiosity-Led)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your target audience has a burning question they haven't found a good answer to. Question-led ads drive high CTR because the viewer feels the ad is for them specifically.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a curiosity-driven copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that opens with a provocative question your [TARGET AUDIENCE] is secretly asking themselves: [QUESTION — e.g., "What would you do with 10 extra hours a week?"]. Paragraph 2: empathize with why they're asking. Paragraph 3: introduce [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] as the answer. Paragraph 4: one benefit, one social proof signal, one CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "solopreneurs managing their own marketing"
- [QUESTION] — e.g., "Why does everyone else seem to post content effortlessly?"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A four-paragraph Facebook ad (~110 words) that opens with a resonant question, builds empathy, introduces the solution, and closes with a benefit-CTA. Conversational tone.

---

### FB-11: Facebook Ad — Competitor Comparison (Without Naming Names)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your audience is actively comparing options. You can reference "other solutions" or "subscription tools" without naming competitors — positions your offer as superior on the dimensions that matter to your buyer.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a positioning copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that contrasts it favorably with [CATEGORY OF COMPETITOR — e.g., "monthly subscription copywriting tools"]. Do not name specific competitors. Contrast on: [DIFFERENTIATOR 1 — e.g., "one-time payment vs. monthly fees"], [DIFFERENTIATOR 2 — e.g., "you own the prompts vs. losing access if you cancel"], [DIFFERENTIATOR 3 — e.g., "works with any AI tool vs. locked to one platform"]. End with CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [CATEGORY OF COMPETITOR] — e.g., "AI writing subscriptions charging $49/month"
- [DIFFERENTIATOR 1/2/3] — Your three strongest advantages

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A comparison-style Facebook ad (~110 words) that positions your offer as the smarter choice without attack-style language. Tone is confident and matter-of-fact.

---

### FB-12: Facebook Ad — Story Format (Personal Narrative)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when you want to build connection and trust before the pitch. Story ads have lower immediate CTR but higher engagement and purchase rates from warm audiences. Best used after initial awareness campaigns.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a storytelling copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a personal narrative structure. Story: [CHARACTER — e.g., "a freelancer"] faced [PROBLEM]. They tried [FAILED SOLUTION]. Then they found [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Result: [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]. Lesson: one sentence that makes the reader see themselves in the story. CTA: invite them to get the same result. Primary text 150-200 words. First-person or third-person voice: [VOICE].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [CHARACTER] — e.g., "a solopreneur running three client accounts"

- [SPECIFIC OUTCOME] — e.g., "cut content creation from 6 hours to 45 minutes a week"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 150-200 word narrative Facebook ad with a clear story arc (problem → failed solution → discovery → result) and a CTA that invites the reader into the same transformation.

---

### FB-13: Facebook Ad — Objection Crusher

**CONTEXT:**
Use for audiences who've been exposed to your offer but haven't converted. This ad format directly names the objection and demolishes it before asking for the click.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an objection-handling copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting people who have the objection: "[OBJECTION — e.g., 'AI copy doesn't sound like me']". Open by naming the objection directly. Then systematically dismantle it with: [COUNTERPOINT 1], [COUNTERPOINT 2], and [SOCIAL PROOF OR EXAMPLE]. Close with a low-risk CTA that reduces perceived risk: [LOW-RISK CTA — e.g., "Try one prompt free before you buy"]. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [OBJECTION] — e.g., "I'm not technical enough to use AI prompts"

- [LOW-RISK CTA] — e.g., "Download 5 free prompts and see for yourself"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 110-word objection-busting Facebook ad that opens with the named objection, provides a two-step logical rebuttal, and closes with a risk-reducing CTA.

---

### FB-14: Facebook Ad — Price Anchor (Justify the Investment)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your product has a price point that feels high relative to competing free options. Anchoring against the cost of alternatives (freelancers, subscriptions, time) reframes price as a bargain.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a price-justification copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] priced at [PRICE — e.g., "$47"]. Anchor the price against: [ALTERNATIVE 1 COST — e.g., "hiring a copywriter: $500+ per project"] and [ALTERNATIVE 2 COST — e.g., "Jasper subscription: $49/month = $588/year"]. Show the math explicitly. Then state what [PRICE] actually gets them. CTA must mention the price to qualify buyers. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Full Kit"
- [PRICE] — e.g., "$47 one-time"
- [ALTERNATIVE 1 COST] — e.g., "a freelance copywriter charges $150-500 per ad"
- [ALTERNATIVE 2 COST] — e.g., "$49/month AI tools = $588/year"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A price-anchoring Facebook ad (~110 words) that makes $47 (or your price) feel like an obvious no-brainer by contrast with real alternatives. Headline includes the price.

---

### FB-15: Facebook Ad — Social Currency ("What Buyers Are Saying")

**CONTEXT:**
Use user-generated quote-style social proof to make an ad feel like a peer recommendation rather than brand messaging. Works best when you have real testimonial language to draw from.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a testimonial ad copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that opens with a paraphrased or real customer quote: "[TESTIMONIAL QUOTE — e.g., 'I wrote a week of content in 20 minutes. This thing is stupid easy.']". Follow with: who said it ([BUYER PERSONA — e.g., "freelance marketer, 3 years experience"]), what they used the product for, and 2 more supporting proof points. CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [TESTIMONIAL QUOTE] — Use a real quote or write a plausible representative one
- [BUYER PERSONA] — e.g., "agency owner managing 5 client accounts"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A testimonial-led Facebook ad (~110 words) that opens with a customer voice, grounds it with persona detail, and layers in additional social proof before the CTA.

---

### LI-01: LinkedIn Sponsored Content Ad — Thought Leadership

**CONTEXT:**
Use for LinkedIn campaigns targeting B2B audiences. LinkedIn users respond to insight and expertise, not hard sells. This prompt leads with a valuable insight, then naturally introduces your product.

---

### LI-02: LinkedIn Lead Gen Form Ad — Gated Resource

**CONTEXT:**
Use to drive LinkedIn Lead Gen Form submissions (name + email pre-filled from profile). Offer must have high perceived professional value — whitepapers, templates, and toolkits work better than "free guides."

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn lead gen copywriter. Write an ad promoting [LEAD MAGNET NAME — e.g., "The AI Marketing Toolkit: 5 Prompts for Better Campaign Copy"]. Target: [JOB TITLE/AUDIENCE]. Headline (70 chars max): state the specific value.

---

### LI-03: LinkedIn InMail — Cold Outreach for Digital Product

Use for LinkedIn Sponsored InMail targeting professionals who match your ICP. InMail must feel personally written — mass-blast language kills response rates. Keep it short and make the ask small.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn InMail copywriter. Write a sponsored InMail for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting [JOB TITLE — e.g., "marketing consultants running their own practice"]. Subject line (60 chars max): make it feel personal and relevant. Body (300 words max): reference something specific about their role, identify the problem [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] solves for people in their position, describe the offer in 2 sentences, and make the ask: [SMALL ASK — e.g., "Would it be useful?

A LinkedIn InMail with subject line (under 60 chars) and body (under 300 words) that reads as a personal message, not a sales blast. Soft close with a small, specific ask.

---

### LI-04: LinkedIn Text Ad — Compact B2B

**CONTEXT:**
Use for LinkedIn Text Ads (right-rail desktop ads). These are tiny — just a headline and 2 lines of text — so every word must earn its place. They work best for high-intent, solution-aware audiences.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an empathy-driven copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using the "I used to / until I found / now I" format. "I used to": [RELATABLE STRUGGLE — e.g., "spend 4 hours writing one Facebook ad"]. "Until I found": [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] and what specifically changed.

A first-person, three-part narrative Facebook ad (~110 words) using the I used to/until/now structure. Reads like a peer recommendation, not an advertisement.

---

### FB-18: Facebook Ad — Number/List Hook

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your product's value can be expressed as a specific number or list. "5 reasons," "3 things," and "47 prompts for X" hooks stop scroll because they promise concrete, countable value.

A seasonally-framed Facebook ad (~110 words) that uses the seasonal moment to create relevance, not just a sale hook. Headline references the season or timing.

---

### FB-20: Facebook Ad — DTC Product Launch (Cold Audience)

**CONTEXT:**
Use on launch day for a cold audience who has never heard of your product. This format introduces the product, establishes why it exists, and drives first-purchase action in one ad.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a DTC launch copywriter. Write a launch-day Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting a completely cold audience. Structure: Line 1: grab attention with a bold claim or problem statement. Lines 2-4: what the product is, who it's for, what makes it different from existing options.

Primary text (150 words): open with the problem, preview 3 pages of the document, explain who benefits, invite the download. Headline (70 chars): document title or a curiosity-gap variation. The document pitch should feel like a generous gift, not a lead capture.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [DOCUMENT TITLE] — e.g., "The AI Content Framework: 5 Prompts Every Marketer Should Know"
- [3 PAGE PREVIEWS] — e.g., "Page 1: Why AI prompts fail / Page 3: The AIDA prompt template / Page 5: The 30-min content sprint"

---

### FB-21: Facebook Ad — Free Trial or Sample Offer

**PROMPT:**
Act as a low-friction offer copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for a free sample of [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. The free offer: [FREE OFFER — e.g., "5 prompts from the full kit, delivered instantly"].

---

### FB-22: Facebook Ad — Pain Point Stack (Multiple Pains)

List 4 specific pain points your [TARGET AUDIENCE] experiences: [PAIN 1], [PAIN 2], [PAIN 3], [PAIN 4]. Format: "Still [pain]? Still [pain]? Still [pain]? Still [pain]?" Then: "There's a better way."

---

---

### FB-23: Facebook Ad — Audience Exclusion (Anti-Audience Targeting)

**PROMPT:**
Act as a targeting copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that uses anti-audience language to qualify clicks. Include: 3 "this is NOT for you if" statements targeting the wrong buyer: [EXCLUSION 1], [EXCLUSION 2], [EXCLUSION 3].

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A qualifier-driven Facebook ad (~130 words) using contrasting exclusion/inclusion lists that pre-qualify the click and make the CTA feel like it's addressing a specific person.

---

In 3 bullet points, name the 3 most impactful things it does. Close with the launch offer or access details. Primary text: 200 words max. Headline: 70 chars.

---

### FB-24: Facebook Ad — Testimonial Montage (3 voices)

Buyer 1: [BUYER TYPE 1 — e.g., "freelancer"]. Buyer 2: [BUYER TYPE 2 — e.g., "agency owner"]. Buyer 3: [BUYER TYPE 3 — e.g., "solopreneur"].

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A three-testimonial Facebook ad (~130 words) with clearly attributed buyer voices, a brief offer summary, and CTA. Reads like a Reddit thread of real opinions, not marketing copy.

---

### GOOG-09: Google Ads — Callout Extensions Set

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Google Ads sitelink specialist. Write 4 sitelink extensions for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Pages to link: [PAGE 1], [PAGE 2], [PAGE 3], [PAGE 4]. For each: Sitelink headline (25 chars max), Description line 1 (35 chars max), Description line 2 (35 chars max). Make each sitelink feel like a distinct reason to click — not just navigation labels.

---

### FB-25: Facebook Ad — Problem/Solution Split Test Pair

**PROMPT:**
Act as a split-test ad copywriter. Write two Facebook ad variants for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] for an A/B test: Variant A (problem-led): open with [CORE PAIN — e.g., "You're spending 5 hours a week on content that gets 3 likes"]. Build empathy, introduce product as relief, CTA. Variant B (solution-led): open with [DESIRED OUTCOME — e.g., "What if you could write a month of content in one afternoon?"].

Two parallel Facebook ad variants (~110 words each) with identical CTA and headline, differing only in problem-vs-solution opening. Clearly labeled for split testing.

---

---

### FB-26: Facebook Ad — Lifestyle/Identity Angle

**PROMPT:**
Act as an identity-based copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that appeals to [TARGET AUDIENCE]'s professional identity. The identity statement: "The kind of [ROLE] who [POSITIVE IDENTITY TRAIT — e.g., 'shows up with ready-to-run copy, not excuses']." Build the ad around this identity.

An identity-driven Facebook ad (~110 words) that makes owning [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] feel like a statement of professional values, not a purchase decision.

---

### FB-27: Facebook Ad — Micro-Commitment (Low-Barrier Entry)

---

### GOOG-11: Google Ads — Price Extension Set

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Google Ads price extension specialist. Write a price extension set for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] with 3-8 items. For each: item type (product, service, or tier), item header (25 chars max), item description (25 chars max), price, and price qualifier (e.g., "per month" or "one-time").

---

### FB-28: Facebook Ad — Founder Story (Origin/Why)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when you want to build trust by humanizing the product. Founder story ads explain why the product was built — and when the "why" is relatable (i.e., the founder had the same problem), it creates powerful connection.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a founder story ad writer. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a founder origin story. The founder (can be unnamed/anonymous): had [FOUNDER PROBLEM — e.g., "spent $2,000 on a freelance copywriter and got unusable copy"]. Tried [FAILED ALTERNATIVES]. Built [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] to solve the problem for themselves. Now offering it to [TARGET AUDIENCE]. CTA. Primary text 150-175 words. Tone: honest, direct, human — not "I built an amazing product!"

- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [FOUNDER PROBLEM] — e.g., "couldn't afford a copywriter but AI outputs were too generic to use"

---

### LI-10: LinkedIn Sponsored Content — Data-Backed Insight

Write a sponsored content post for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that opens with a data point or statistic: [STAT — e.g., "Marketers using structured AI prompts produce content 3x faster than those using open-ended prompts (internal data, n=200 buyers)"].

Use this pattern when your product solves a problem most people don't realize they have, or when there's a counterintuitive truth in your category. The "most people don't know" hook is a curiosity trigger that earns the next sentence.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a copywriter specializing in curiosity-gap hooks. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] opening with: "Most [TARGET AUDIENCE] don't know that [COUNTERINTUITIVE TRUTH — e.g., 'the reason their AI copy sounds robotic isn't the AI — it's the prompt']." Expand on the truth for 2-3 sentences. Then show how [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] solves the underlying issue. CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "marketers using ChatGPT"
- [COUNTERINTUITIVE TRUTH] — e.g., "the prompt structure matters 10x more than the AI model you use"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A curiosity-hook Facebook ad (~110 words) that opens with a surprising truth, explains it accessibly, and positions the product as the informed solution. Conversational and educational tone.

### FB-30: Facebook Ad — Specificity Anchor ("Exactly X")

**CONTEXT:**
Specific numbers outperform vague claims in ad copy. "Exactly 500 prompts" beats "hundreds of prompts." "Write ads in 23 minutes" beats "write ads fast." This prompt builds an ad around hyper-specific claims.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a specificity-driven ad copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using exact numbers throughout: [SPECIFIC CLAIM 1 — e.g., "exactly 500 prompts"], [SPECIFIC CLAIM 2 — e.g., "8 marketing categories"], [SPECIFIC CLAIM 3 — e.g., "$47 one-time — not $49/month"]. Make each claim land by adding brief context for why it matters. End with CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [SPECIFIC CLAIM 1/2/3] — Use your actual product metrics, not placeholders

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A specificity-anchored Facebook ad (~110 words) where every major claim is a specific number or figure, not a vague descriptor. Reads as credible and precise.

---

### GOOG-12: Google Ads — Smart Campaign Copy Brief

**CONTEXT:**
Use when setting up Google Smart Campaigns (used by small businesses). Smart Campaigns require a brief, a description, and 3 items to highlight. This prompt generates a complete smart campaign brief.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Google Smart Campaign copywriter. Write a Smart Campaign brief for [BUSINESS/PRODUCT NAME]. Business description (100 chars): what you sell and for whom. 3 highlight items (30 chars each): your three most compelling differentiators or offers. These will appear in auto-generated ads. Make each highlight standalone — it may appear alone or combined with others.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BUSINESS/PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit — AI Marketing Prompts"
- [3 HIGHLIGHTS] — e.g., "500+ prompts, $47 one-time / Works with ChatGPT & Claude / Instant download"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A Smart Campaign brief with a 100-character business description and three 30-character highlights. All character-count compliant and differentiated.

---

### FB-31: Facebook Ad — Niche Audience Targeting (Hyper-Specific)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when targeting a hyper-specific sub-audience rather than a broad category. The more your ad speaks to a narrow group's exact situation, the higher the CTR and conversion rate. "You're a [specific role] who [specific situation]" outperforms broad targeting copy.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a niche-targeting copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] written specifically for [HYPER-SPECIFIC AUDIENCE — e.g., "freelance social media managers handling 5+ client accounts simultaneously"]. The ad must reference their specific context: [CONTEXT DETAIL — e.g., "you're juggling 5 content calendars in your head"]. Show how [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] solves their exact, specific problem. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [HYPER-SPECIFIC AUDIENCE] — e.g., "coaches and consultants marketing their own services"
- [CONTEXT DETAIL] — e.g., "you write all your own content between client calls"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A hyper-targeted Facebook ad (~110 words) that reads as if it was written for one specific person in a specific situation. High relevance score potential.

---

### FB-32: Facebook Ad — Post-Purchase Upsell

**CONTEXT:**
Use in retargeting campaigns targeting confirmed buyers of your lower-tier product. The buyer already trusts you — this ad removes friction for the upgrade by referencing their prior purchase.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an upsell ad copywriter. Write a Facebook retargeting ad for buyers of [LOWER-TIER PRODUCT] promoting an upgrade to [UPPER-TIER PRODUCT]. Acknowledge they already own [LOWER-TIER PRODUCT]. Show specifically what they're missing: [UPGRADE FEATURES — e.g., "300 additional prompts + 4 Notion templates they don't have yet"]. Frame the upgrade price as completing their investment, not a new purchase. CTA: [UPGRADE CTA — e.g., "Upgrade for the difference — $20 more"]. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [LOWER-TIER PRODUCT] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Starter ($27)"
- [UPPER-TIER PRODUCT] — e.g., "Full Kit ($47)"
- [UPGRADE FEATURES] — e.g., "300 extra prompts, 4 Notion templates, video script category"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A buyer-aware upsell Facebook ad (~110 words) that acknowledges the existing purchase, clearly names the upgrade value, and offers a low-friction path to the higher tier.

---

### GOOG-13: Google Ads — Dynamic Search Ad Descriptions

**CONTEXT:**
Dynamic Search Ads auto-generate headlines from your landing page. You provide only the descriptions. This prompt generates 3 description variants that pair effectively with auto-generated DSA headlines.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Google Ads DSA specialist. Write 3 descriptions for Dynamic Search Ads promoting [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Each description (90 chars max) must stand alone without a specific headline — since headlines are generated dynamically. Each should communicate a different value: (1) primary benefit, (2) offer/price, (3) risk-reduction/guarantee. Descriptions must be compelling without context from the headline.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- Adjust price, offer terms, and guarantee language to match your actual offer

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
3 standalone DSA descriptions (90 chars max each) that each communicate a distinct value without relying on a headline for context. Labeled by value type.

---

### LI-11: LinkedIn Spotlight Ad — Personal Profile Target

**CONTEXT:**
LinkedIn Spotlight Ads appear in the right rail and show the viewer's profile photo (dynamic). They feel personally addressed. Use to drive high-intent professionals to a specific destination with a clear, personal CTA.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn Spotlight Ad copywriter. Write copy for a Spotlight Ad promoting [DESTINATION — e.g., "free download: 5 AI Marketing Prompts"]. Headline (50 chars): must feel personally relevant to [JOB TITLE]. Description (70 chars): state the specific benefit of clicking. CTA label (18 chars): action-focused. The ad auto-inserts the viewer's name/photo — write copy that feels like a personal invitation.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [DESTINATION] — e.g., "Free PDF: 5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"
- [JOB TITLE] — e.g., "marketing consultants" or "freelance marketers"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A Spotlight Ad with headline (50 chars), description (70 chars), and CTA label (18 chars). Character-count compliant and written to feel like a personal, relevant invitation.

---

### FB-33: Facebook Ad — "What If" Aspiration Frame

**CONTEXT:**
Use to open with a compelling hypothetical that makes the reader immediately imagine a better version of their situation. "What if" frames are especially effective for productivity, business, and lifestyle products.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an aspiration copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] opening with "What if [ASPIRATION — e.g., 'you never had to stare at a blank page again']?" Develop the "what if" world for 2-3 sentences. Then show that [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] makes this possible. Include one proof point. CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [ASPIRATION] — e.g., "your marketing ran itself while you focused on clients"

An aspiration-led Facebook ad (~110 words) that opens with a compelling hypothetical, develops the desired future state, and positions the product as the path to that state.

---

### FB-34: Facebook Ad — Product Demo Invitation

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your product is best understood by seeing it in action. A "see how it works" ad drives to a demo, walkthrough video, or product preview page rather than directly to a purchase.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a demo-invitation copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that invites the viewer to see a live example rather than buy immediately. Tease [DEMO CONTENT — e.g., "watch how this prompt generates a full Facebook ad in 45 seconds"]. Make the demo feel worth 60 seconds of their time. CTA: [DEMO CTA — e.g., "Watch the 60-second demo"]. Primary text under 100 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [DEMO CONTENT] — e.g., "see how one prompt from the kit generates 5 ad variants instantly"

A low-friction demo invitation Facebook ad (~90 words) that makes "just watching" feel like a compelling action. Ideal for consideration-stage retargeting.

---

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Google Ads extensions specialist. Write 2 structured snippet extension sets for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Set 1 header type: "Types" — list 6-10 items (25 chars max each) representing the product types or categories. Set 2 header type: "Features" — list 6-10 features (25 chars max each). Label each set and provide character counts.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
Two structured snippet extension sets (Types + Features) with 6-10 items each, all under 25 characters. Ready to add directly to Google Ads campaign.

---

### FB-35: Facebook Ad — Win-Back (Lapsed Audience)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for re-engagement campaigns targeting people who engaged with your ads 60-180 days ago but never purchased. Acknowledge the time gap without being weird about it, and give them a new reason to act.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a win-back ad copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting people who showed interest 60-180 days ago but didn't purchase. Don't mention the time gap directly — instead, use "a lot has changed" framing or introduce new content. Highlight: [WHAT'S NEW — e.g., "we just added 100 new prompts to the kit"]. Include a fresh offer or reason to come back now. CTA. Primary text under 100 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A win-back Facebook ad (~90 words) that reintroduces the offer with a fresh angle and gives a new, specific reason to act now. No "we miss you" clichés.

---

### FB-36: Facebook Ad — Curiosity Gap (Tease Without Reveal)

**CONTEXT:**
Use curiosity-gap hooks when you want to drive clicks to a page where the full answer is revealed. The ad creates an information gap — a question or partial insight — that can only be resolved by clicking.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a curiosity-gap copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that teases a specific insight without fully revealing it: "[PARTIAL INSIGHT — e.g., 'There's one type of Facebook ad that converts 3x better than every other format — and almost nobody uses it.']" Build intrigue for 2 sentences. CTA: invite them to click to find out. Do not reveal the answer in the ad. Primary text under 100 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PARTIAL INSIGHT] — e.g., "One prompt structure outperforms every other type of AI copywriting request — and it's not what you'd guess"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A curiosity-gap Facebook ad (~90 words) with a compelling unresolved tease and a click-worthy CTA. The answer is on the landing page, not in the ad.

---

### GOOG-15: Google Ads — Brand Awareness Campaign (Non-Conversion)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for top-of-funnel brand awareness campaigns where the goal is impression share, not clicks. Copy must be memorable and brand-forward rather than CTA-heavy.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a brand awareness campaign copywriter. Write Google Display and YouTube ad copy for a brand awareness campaign for [BRAND NAME]. Display text ad: headline (25 chars), description (90 chars) — focus on brand positioning, not conversion. YouTube bumper ad (6 seconds, ~20 words): one memorable brand statement. YouTube skippable ad hook (5 seconds, ~15 words): must stop the skip. Brand message: [BRAND MESSAGE — e.g., "AI prompts that actually sound like you"].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [BRAND MESSAGE] — e.g., "Stop writing from scratch. Start writing with a system."

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
Three branded awareness copy units: display ad (headline + description), 6-second bumper (20 words), and 5-second skippable hook (15 words). All optimized for memorability over conversion.

---

### LI-12: LinkedIn Sponsored Content — ROI Calculator Teaser

**CONTEXT:**
Use to drive LinkedIn users to an interactive ROI calculator or value assessment tool. ROI tools generate high-quality leads because they attract users who are actively evaluating options.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn lead gen tool copywriter. Write a sponsored content ad driving to an ROI calculator for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Headline (70 chars): promise a specific, calculable result. Primary text (150 words): identify the decision [TARGET AUDIENCE] is trying to make, explain what the calculator reveals, list 3 inputs it asks for. CTA: [CTA — e.g., "Calculate your time savings"]. Frame the calculator as a tool, not a gimmick.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"

- [3 INPUTS] — e.g., "hours/week on content creation / hourly rate / team size"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A LinkedIn ad (~145 words + 70-char headline) that makes a ROI calculator feel genuinely valuable to evaluate before a purchase decision. Not gimmicky — practical and specific.

---

### FB-37: Facebook Ad — "Everyone's Talking About" Social Momentum

**CONTEXT:**
Use when you have real evidence of buzz, community adoption, or rapid growth. Social momentum framing creates FOMO — the sense that everyone who matters has already discovered this and you haven't yet.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a social momentum copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using social momentum framing: "[NUMBER] [TARGET AUDIENCE] are already using [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] to [OUTCOME]." Build the momentum story — why it's spreading, who's using it, what's driving the growth. Include a social proof metric. CTA: invite them to join. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [NUMBER] — e.g., "500+" — use real numbers
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "freelancers and solopreneurs"
- [OUTCOME] — e.g., "cut their content creation time in half"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A social momentum Facebook ad (~110 words) that builds the sense of a growing movement, makes the CTA feel like joining something, not just buying something.

---

### FB-38: Facebook Ad — Guarantee/Risk-Reversal

**CONTEXT:**
Use when purchase hesitation is about risk ("what if it doesn't work for me?"). A strong, specific guarantee removes the last barrier to purchase for fence-sitters who otherwise want the product.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a risk-reversal copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] where the guarantee is the hero of the ad. Guarantee details: [GUARANTEE — e.g., "30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked"]. Open with the guarantee (not buried at the end). Show how it removes risk. Then make the product case. CTA: frame the purchase as risk-free. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [GUARANTEE] — e.g., "100% money-back if you don't use at least 10 prompts within 30 days"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A guarantee-led Facebook ad (~110 words) where the risk-reversal is introduced in the first two sentences and the rest of the ad is spent making the confident purchase case.

## Category 2: Emails

These prompts cover the full email marketing lifecycle — from first-touch welcome sequences to abandoned cart recovery to long-term nurture to re-engagement campaigns. Each prompt targets a specific email type, psychological trigger, and funnel position so you produce emails that get opened and acted on, not ignored.

---

### EM-01: Welcome Email — Single-Product Purchase

---

### EM-02: Welcome Sequence Email 2 — "How to Get Results Fast"

**CONTEXT:**
Send 24-48 hours after purchase. Most buyers don't use products they buy within the first 48 hours — this email activates them by giving a specific, simple action that produces an immediate result.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product activation email writer. Write a Day 2 welcome sequence email for [PRODUCT NAME] buyers. Goal: get them to use the product and get one quick win before they forget about it. Structure: (1) acknowledge they just bought, (2) give them one specific, easy action to take in 10 minutes, (3) tell them exactly what result they'll get from that action, (4) soft CTA to reply with their result.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A Day 2 activation email (~175 words) with subject line, preview text, and body. Focused on getting the buyer one specific quick win that proves product value.

---

### EM-03: Welcome Sequence Email 3 — Social Proof + Upsell

**PROMPT:**
Act as a retention and upsell email writer. Write a Day 5 email for [LOWER-TIER PRODUCT] buyers. Structure: (1) ask if they've tried the product yet — share a relatable buyer experience, (2) share 2-3 buyer results (paraphrased or representative testimonials), (3) soft mention that buyers who upgrade to [UPPER-TIER PRODUCT] get [UPGRADE BENEFIT — e.g., "300 more prompts + 4 Notion templates"], (4) upgrade CTA (not pushy — "if you want more").

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [LOWER-TIER PRODUCT] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Starter"

---

### EM-04: Abandoned Cart Email 1 — Reminder (Soft)

**CONTEXT:**

**PROMPT:**
Act as an abandoned cart email specialist. Write a soft abandoned cart email for [PRODUCT NAME] priced at [PRICE]. The buyer added to cart but didn't complete purchase. Tone: friendly and helpful, as if they left something behind by mistake.

---

### EM-05: Abandoned Cart Email 2 — Objection Handler

**CONTEXT:**
Send 24 hours after first abandonment email. This email handles the most likely reason they didn't buy — without being presumptuous. Name the objection directly and dissolve it.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an objection-handling email copywriter. Write a second abandoned cart email for [PRODUCT NAME]. It's been 24 hours since they added to cart. This email must address the most likely objection: [MOST LIKELY OBJECTION — e.g., "not sure if AI prompts will sound like my brand"]. Acknowledge the hesitation with empathy. Provide specific counterpoint. End with return-to-cart CTA and a brief guarantee mention. Under 200 words.

---

### EM-06: Abandoned Cart Email 3 — Final Urgency

**CONTEXT:**
Send 48-72 hours after abandonment. Final email in the cart sequence. Now you can apply urgency — either a deadline, a price reminder, or a "last chance" framing. Be direct about it.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a cart recovery urgency email writer. Write a final abandoned cart email for [PRODUCT NAME]. Urgency mechanism: [URGENCY — e.g., "launch price of $47 ends Friday at midnight" or "we're removing the bonus in 24 hours"]. Subject line: lead with the deadline.

Use immediately when someone downloads your free lead magnet. This email delivers the resource, introduces the brand, and plants the seed for the paid product — without pitching too early.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a lead magnet delivery email writer. Write the delivery email for [LEAD MAGNET NAME — e.g., "5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"]. Structure: (1) deliver the resource immediately (link or attachment), (2) one sentence on how to use it for maximum value, (3) brief brand introduction — who you are and what you do, (4) tease what's coming next in the email sequence (not a sales pitch yet).

---

### EM-08: Nurture Email 1 — Education (Teach, Don't Sell)

**CONTEXT:**
Send Day 2-3 of lead magnet nurture sequence. The goal is to deliver standalone value — teach something useful — while subtly establishing that you know what you're talking about. No sales pitch in this email.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an educational email writer. Write a nurture email that teaches [TOPIC — e.g., "why most AI marketing prompts fail (and what to do instead)"]. Teach the lesson in 250-300 words: (1) name the common mistake, (2) explain why it happens, (3) give a specific fix, (4) optional: connect to your product in one final sentence only.

A 250-300 word educational nurture email with subject line. Standalone value — reader benefits from opening this whether they ever buy or not. Product mentioned at most once and not promotionally.

---

### EM-09: Nurture Email 2 — Case Study / Mini Story

**CONTEXT:**
Send Day 4-5 of nurture sequence. Stories convert better than facts because they create identification — readers project themselves into the character's situation. Use a buyer story to show transformation.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a story-driven email writer. Write a nurture email featuring a mini case study for [PRODUCT NAME]. Character: [BUYER TYPE — e.g., "a freelance marketer managing 4 client accounts"].

A 275-word social proof email with subject line featuring 4-5 attributed quotes from diverse buyer types and a guarantee-backed CTA. Reads as evidence, not marketing.

---

### EM-11: Nurture Email 4 — Objection FAQ

A 325-word FAQ-style nurture email with 3 honest objection responses and a risk-reversed CTA. Tone is transparent and direct — reads as authentic problem-solving, not sales spin.

---

### EM-12: Nurture Email 5 — Final Ask (Last Chance)

**CONTEXT:**
Send Day 10-12 of nurture sequence. Final promotional email. Be direct about the ask — by now the reader knows who you are and what you sell. A clear, honest final ask outperforms another value email.

Be direct: acknowledge they've received several emails, say you won't keep selling this, and make the final case clearly. Include: what they get, the price, the guarantee, and a direct CTA.

---

### EM-13: Promotional Email — Flash Sale

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a 48-72 hour flash sale to an existing email list. Primes buyers with a specific discount or bonus, creates urgency with a hard deadline. Works best sent to non-buyers on your list.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a flash sale email copywriter. Write a flash sale announcement email for [PRODUCT NAME]. Sale details: [DISCOUNT OR BONUS — e.g., "30% off" or "buy Full Kit, get email swipe file free"].

---

### EM-14: Promotional Email — New Content/Update Announcement

**CONTEXT:**
Use when you add significant new content to an existing product — new prompts, new templates, new categories. Existing buyers get value; non-buyers get a new reason to purchase.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product update email writer. Write an update announcement email for [PRODUCT NAME]. What's new: [UPDATE — e.g., "100 new prompts added across 3 categories + new video scripts section"]. For existing buyers: how to access the update (if applicable). For non-buyers: frame the update as an expanded offer at the same price. CTA: invite non-buyers to get everything now. Subject: lead with what's new, not "update announcement." Under 225 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [UPDATE] — e.g., "Added: 50 new video script prompts, 30 new SEO prompts, and a brand new Email category"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 200-word product update email that rewards existing buyers and creates a fresh purchase trigger for non-buyers. Subject leads with the new content, not housekeeping language.

---

### EM-15: Promotional Email — Re-Engagement (Inactive Subscribers)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for subscribers who haven't opened in 60-90 days. The goal is to either re-engage them or identify them for list cleaning. Be direct about the re-engagement ask — vague "we miss you" emails don't work.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a re-engagement email specialist. Write a re-engagement email for [BRAND NAME] subscribers who haven't opened in 60+ days. Format: (1) acknowledge directly ("You haven't heard from us in a while — that's fair"), (2) give them a specific reason to stay on the list, (3) offer something of value to re-engage: [RE-ENGAGEMENT OFFER — e.g., "free prompt sample PDF"], (4) include a "stay subscribed" CTA and a "unsubscribe" link explicitly offered.

- [RE-ENGAGEMENT OFFER] — e.g., "5 free prompts from the kit, no purchase needed"

A 175-word re-engagement email that's honest about the gap, makes a clear value offer, and gives subscribers an easy choice to stay or go without pressure.

---

### EM-16: Cold Outreach Email — B2B Prospecting

**CONTEXT:**
Use for cold email outreach to a list of qualified prospects. The goal is not to sell — it's to start a conversation. Most cold emails fail because they lead with the pitch. Lead with the prospect's problem.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a B2B cold email specialist. Write a cold outreach email for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting [TARGET COMPANY TYPE — e.g., "marketing agencies with 5-15 employees"]. Subject line: reference something specific about their role or company type. Body (150 words max): (1) one sentence on who you are, (2) identify a specific problem they likely have, (3) one sentence on what [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] does about it, (4) one specific result or proof, (5) small ask: [ASK — e.g., "Is this relevant to your team?

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — agency bundle"

- [ASK] — e.g., "Would it be worth a look? I can send you 10 prompts relevant to agency work."

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 140-word cold email with subject line and body. Leads with prospect problem, not product pitch. Ends with a small, easy ask — not a calendar link or full pitch.

---

### EM-17: Cold Outreach Email — Follow-Up Sequence (3 emails)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the 2nd and 3rd follow-up emails in a cold outreach sequence. Most cold email replies come from follow-ups, not the initial email. Each follow-up must add new value, not just ask "did you see my last email?"

**PROMPT:**
Act as a cold email follow-up specialist. Write a 3-email follow-up sequence following a cold email for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Email 1 (Day 3): add one new piece of value — a specific insight, stat, or result from a similar company type. Email 2 (Day 7): try a different angle — address a different pain point than the original email. Email 3 (Day 14): polite final ask — acknowledge this is the last email, make it easy to reply even with a "not now." Each email: under 100 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [NEW VALUE — Email 1] — e.g., a specific result from your customer data
- [DIFFERENT PAIN — Email 2] — e.g., if original was about time, try quality or cost

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
Three follow-up emails (under 100 words each) with subject lines that don't start with "Re:" or "Following up." Each adds new value or a new angle, not just a repetition of the original ask.

---

### EM-18: Referral Request Email — Existing Buyers

**CONTEXT:**
Use to activate word-of-mouth from satisfied buyers. Best sent 7-14 days after purchase when buyers have used the product and formed an opinion. Referral emails work when they make sharing easy and specific.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a referral program email writer. Write an email to existing buyers of [PRODUCT NAME] asking for a referral. Tone: warm and appreciative. Structure: (1) brief appreciation for their purchase, (2) ask if they know someone who would benefit, (3) make sharing easy: provide a pre-written message they can forward or a link they can share, (4) optional incentive: [INCENTIVE — e.g., "they get $5 off with your link" or "no incentive — just asking"]. Under 200 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PRE-WRITTEN MESSAGE] — e.g., "Hey — I've been using this AI prompt kit for my marketing. It's actually saved me hours. Here's the link if you want to check it out: [URL]"
- [INCENTIVE] — optional — describe or remove

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 175-word referral request email with subject line that makes sharing feel natural and easy. Includes a pre-written shareable message. Not transactional — feels like a genuine ask between peers.

---

### EM-19: Email Subject Line Battery — 20 Variants

**CONTEXT:**

Generate 4 variants each of 5 types: (1) curiosity-gap, (2) direct benefit, (3) urgency/deadline, (4) social proof, (5) question. Each subject line under 50 characters. Label by type and number.

- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [LAUNCH CONTEXT] — e.g., "launch week" or "new version release" or "flash sale"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
20 subject lines in a labeled table: type, number, subject line text, character count. All under 50 characters. Variety in structure and trigger — no two feel identical.

---

### EM-20: Preview Text Optimizations — 10 Variants

**CONTEXT:**
Preview text (the snippet after the subject line in the inbox) dramatically affects open rates. It should complete the subject line's thought, not repeat it. This prompt generates preview text paired with a given subject line.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an inbox optimization specialist. Write 10 preview text variants to pair with this subject line: "[SUBJECT LINE — e.g., 'You left something in your cart']." Preview text requirements: (1) extends or contrasts the subject line — doesn't repeat it, (2) under 90 characters, (3) ends mid-thought if possible (creates curiosity). Generate 10 variants with different tones: 2 urgent, 2 curious, 2 benefit-focused, 2 social proof, 2 direct. Label each by tone.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [SUBJECT LINE] — paste your actual subject line

---

---

**PROMPT:**
Act as a testimonial collection email writer. Write an email requesting feedback from buyers of [PRODUCT NAME]. Subject: curiosity-gap — don't say "review request." Body: (1) acknowledge they've had the product 2 weeks, (2) ask one specific question: "[SPECIFIC QUESTION — e.g., 'What's one marketing task you used the kit for in the last 2 weeks?']", (3) explain how their answer helps future buyers, (4) optional incentive for responding: [INCENTIVE — e.g., "bonus: reply and I'll send you 5 additional prompts"].

---

### EM-26: Email — Black Friday / Cyber Monday Campaign (3-email sequence)

Act as a BFCM email campaign writer. Write 3 emails for [PRODUCT NAME]'s Black Friday/Cyber Monday campaign: Email 1 (Thursday — preview): tease the offer without revealing full details. Email 2 (Friday — launch): announce the offer clearly — price, what's included, deadline. Email 3 (Sunday — last chance): final urgency, close the sale. Each email under 200 words.

### EM-27: Email — Affiliate/Partner Welcome Sequence

---

### EM-28: Email — Upsell Sequence Post-Starter Purchase (3 emails)

**PROMPT:**
Act as an upsell sequence email writer. Write a 3-email sequence upselling [LOWER-TIER] buyers to [UPPER-TIER]. Email 1 (Day 3): no pitch — show them a feature exclusive to the upper tier and let curiosity do the work.

Two win-back emails (under 175 words each) that focus on activation, not re-selling. Helpful and personal tone — acknowledges inactivity without shame.

---

### EM-30: Email — Seasonal Campaign Wrapper

**PROMPT:**
Act as a bundle announcement email writer. Write an email announcing a new bundle for [PRODUCT 1] + [PRODUCT 2] at [BUNDLE PRICE]. Structure: (1) announce the bundle as new/just-added, (2) show the individual prices vs. bundle price (math should be obvious), (3) list what's in each component, (4) who this bundle is for, (5) CTA.

### EM-41: Email — Feedback Survey Invitation

---

### EM-42: Email — Personalization Example (Segmented by Use Case)

Share: (1) one genuine challenge you're working through, (2) one exciting thing that's coming, (3) one decision you made and why. Tone: personal, candid, founder-to-subscriber. No sales pitch.

### EM-49: Email — Year-in-Review / Annual Wrap-Up

Include: (1) one genuine achievement with a real number, (2) one thing that surprised you, (3) one thing that didn't go as planned and what you learned, (4) what's coming in the new year.

---

---

### EM-56: Email — Event / Live Training Invitation

---

### EM-57: Email — Soft Pitch After High-Value Content

### EM-60: Email — NPS Survey and Feedback Loop

Use as a value email to non-buyers on your list. Sharing a free sample of product content is the highest-converting way to convert undecided subscribers — they experience the product before buying.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product sample email writer. Write an email sharing 3 free prompts from [PRODUCT NAME] as a no-strings value piece for non-buyers on your list. Include 3 complete, usable prompts (shorter format — just the prompt and context, no full structure needed in this email). After the 3 prompts: brief CTA to get all 500+ in the full kit. Under 350 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [3 SAMPLE PROMPTS] — choose 3 of your best, most broadly applicable prompts

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 325-word value email with 3 complete, usable sample prompts and a brief CTA at the end. Provides genuine standalone value — readers can use the prompts without buying anything.

---

### EM-65: Email — Permission Reminder (List Hygiene)

**CONTEXT:**
Use periodically to remind subscribers why they're on your list and invite inactive ones to self-select out. Permission reminder emails improve deliverability and reduce spam complaints from people who forgot they subscribed.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a list hygiene email writer. Write a permission reminder email for [BRAND NAME] to subscribers who may not remember signing up. Remind them how they subscribed, what they receive, and what's coming next. Give them a direct, dignified way to unsubscribe if it's no longer relevant. Tone: respectful and non-manipulative — no guilt for leaving. Under 175 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [HOW THEY SUBSCRIBED] — e.g., "you downloaded our free AI prompt PDF earlier this year"
- [WHAT THEY RECEIVE] — describe your actual email content

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 155-word permission reminder email with a clear explanation of the subscription, a preview of upcoming content, and a dignified unsubscribe acknowledgment. Improves list health by self-selecting engaged subscribers.

## Category 3: Social Media

These prompts cover every major social platform and format — Instagram captions, LinkedIn posts, Twitter/X threads, TikTok and Reels scripts, Pinterest descriptions, and carousel copy. Each prompt targets a specific platform's content conventions, audience psychology, and algorithm behavior so your content fits the feed, not fights it.

---

### SM-01: Instagram Caption — Educational Carousel (Hook + Swipe + CTA)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for Instagram carousel posts that teach something in 5-10 slides. The caption introduces the topic and hooks the reader into swiping. Carousels have the highest average reach of any Instagram format.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an Instagram content strategist. Write an Instagram carousel caption for a post teaching [TOPIC — e.g., "how to write Facebook ads using the PAS framework"]. Caption structure: Hook (first line — must stop the scroll and promise value), 1-2 sentences expanding on what they'll learn, CTA to swipe. Under 100 words. The first line is the most important — it must work as a standalone scroll-stopper. Also suggest 5 slide titles for the carousel.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TOPIC] — e.g., "3 AI prompt structures that write better ads than most copywriters"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "small business owners writing their own ads"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
An Instagram carousel caption under 100 words with a hook-first structure and swipe CTA, plus 5 suggested carousel slide titles. Ready to pair with designed slides.

---

### SM-02: Instagram Caption — Product Feature (Single Image)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a single-image product post on Instagram. The caption must work without the visual — assume the image shows the product, so the caption sells the benefit and context.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an Instagram product copywriter. Write a single-image Instagram product caption for [PRODUCT NAME]. Structure: (1) open with a benefit statement, not the product name, (2) 2-3 sentences expanding on who it's for and what they get, (3) social proof line (one number or quote), (4) CTA with link-in-bio instruction. Under 125 words. Use line breaks for readability. Include 5 relevant hashtags at the end.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [BENEFIT] — e.g., "write a month of marketing copy in one afternoon"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] — e.g., "500+ marketers use this" or "4.9 stars"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 110-word Instagram product caption with line breaks, benefit-first structure, social proof, CTA, and 5 hashtags. Reads as natural Instagram content, not an ad.

---

### SM-03: Instagram Caption — Personal Story / Relatable Moment

**CONTEXT:**
Use for organic engagement content that builds connection. Relatable story posts perform well when they describe a specific situation your audience recognizes from their own experience.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an Instagram storytelling copywriter. Write an Instagram caption in the personal story format for [NICHE/AUDIENCE — e.g., "freelance marketers"]. Story: describe a specific, relatable moment: [RELATABLE MOMENT — e.g., "that moment when a client asks for 'just a quick email' and it turns into a 3-hour project"]. Develop the moment in 2-3 sentences. End with a question that invites comments. Under 125 words. Conversational voice — first person, natural, no corporate tone.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [NICHE/AUDIENCE] — e.g., "solopreneurs managing their own content"
- [RELATABLE MOMENT] — describe a situation your audience will recognize immediately

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 110-word first-person Instagram caption with a relatable story, brief development, and an engagement-driving question at the end. Reads like a real person's post.

---

### SM-04: Instagram Reel Script — 30-Second Value Hook

**CONTEXT:**
Use for Instagram Reels (30 seconds or less). Reels scripts need a hook in the first 2 seconds, a value delivery in the middle, and a clear CTA at the end. This prompt generates a complete script with on-screen text notes.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Reels script writer. Write a 30-second Instagram Reel script for [TOPIC — e.g., "how to write a Facebook ad using AI in 5 minutes"]. Structure: Hook (0-2 sec): on-screen text + voiceover hook that makes someone stop mid-scroll. Value (2-22 sec): deliver 3 quick tips or steps with on-screen text labels. CTA (22-30 sec): tell them what to do next. Include [ON-SCREEN TEXT] notes in brackets. Total spoken words: 80-100.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TOPIC] — a specific marketing tip or how-to that your audience cares about
- [ON-SCREEN TEXT] — note what text appears on screen at each moment

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A timestamped 30-second Reel script with on-screen text in brackets, voiceover text, and CTA. ~85 spoken words. Ready to film from the script.

---

### SM-05: Instagram Reel Script — Product Demo (60 seconds)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a product demonstration Reel that shows (not tells) how the product works. Show-don't-tell demos convert better than feature lists because viewers can see the value before buying.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product demo Reel scriptwriter. Write a 60-second Instagram Reel script demonstrating [PRODUCT NAME] in action. Structure: Hook (0-3 sec): bold problem or result statement. Setup (3-10 sec): who this is for and what they're about to see. Demo (10-50 sec): show the product being used — describe what appears on screen step by step. Reveal (50-55 sec): the result. CTA (55-60 sec): where to get it. Include [SCREEN NOTE] directions.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [DEMO STEPS] — describe the actual product experience you're demonstrating

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A timestamped 60-second Reel script with screen notes, voiceover, and CTA. Approximately 150 spoken words. Structured to let the product demo do the selling.

---

### SM-06: LinkedIn Post — Thought Leadership (Long-Form)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a high-engagement LinkedIn post that positions you as an expert. LinkedIn's algorithm rewards posts that generate comments — so every thought leadership post should end with a discussion-starting question.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn thought leadership writer. Write a long-form LinkedIn post on [TOPIC — e.g., "why AI prompt quality matters more than the AI model you use"]. Structure: opening hook (one strong statement or counterintuitive claim), main insight developed in 3-4 short paragraphs, one specific example, key takeaway, discussion question. Total: 300-400 words. Use short paragraphs (1-3 sentences each) for mobile readability. No bullet points — flowing prose only.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TOPIC] — a genuine insight in your area of expertise
- [SPECIFIC EXAMPLE] — a concrete, real example that illustrates the main point

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 300-400 word LinkedIn post with a strong opening hook, flowing argument, concrete example, and an engagement-driving final question. Short paragraphs optimized for mobile.

---

### SM-07: LinkedIn Post — Tactical How-To

**CONTEXT:**
Use for LinkedIn posts that teach a specific, actionable framework or process. Tactical posts perform well when they give readers something they can implement the same day.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn tactical content writer. Write a LinkedIn post teaching [FRAMEWORK/PROCESS — e.g., "a 4-step framework for writing AI marketing prompts that actually work"]. Structure: Hook (one line promising the framework). Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4 — each with a label and 2 sentences. Closing takeaway: why this matters. Optional: brief mention of [PRODUCT NAME] as the implementation shortcut. Total: 250-350 words. Use numbered steps with brief labels.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [FRAMEWORK/PROCESS] — e.g., "the ROPE framework: Role, Outcome, Parameters, Examples"
- [PRODUCT NAME] — optional mention of your product as the "done-for-you" version

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 250-350 word LinkedIn tactical post with numbered steps, 2-sentence explanations per step, and a closing insight. Actionable enough to implement without buying anything.

---

### SM-08: LinkedIn Post — Personal Win (Humble Brag Done Right)

**CONTEXT:**
Use to share a milestone, result, or win without coming across as self-congratulatory. The key is to make the win about the audience — turn your result into a lesson they can apply.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn achievement post writer. Write a post sharing [WIN/MILESTONE — e.g., "hitting 500 buyers in 90 days"]. Structure: (1) state the win briefly, (2) immediately pivot to what you learned from it or what made it possible, (3) turn the lesson into a takeaway for your audience, (4) optional: brief mention of relevant product or resource. Total: 200-300 words. Tone: genuine and lesson-focused, not victory lap.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [WIN/MILESTONE] — e.g., "500 buyers / first $10K month / product launch hitting target"
- [LESSON] — the genuine insight behind the win — not "work hard"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 200-300 word LinkedIn achievement post that leads with the win but pivots quickly to audience value. Reads as reflective and generous, not self-promotional.

---

### SM-09: LinkedIn Post — Contrarian Take

**CONTEXT:**
Use to generate engagement by challenging a common belief in your industry. Contrarian posts earn more comments and shares than consensus posts — because people either agree enthusiastically or want to debate.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn contrarian copywriter. Write a post challenging [COMMON BELIEF — e.g., "the idea that AI writing tools are replacing copywriters"]. Structure: (1) state the belief you're challenging directly, (2) your contrarian position in one sentence, (3) 3 supporting arguments, each in 2-3 sentences, (4) nuance — acknowledge what's true in the mainstream view, (5) closing position. Total: 300-400 words. Confident but not aggressive tone.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [COMMON BELIEF] — e.g., "more content = better reach" or "you need to post every day to grow on LinkedIn"
- [YOUR CONTRARIAN POSITION] — must be genuinely defensible, not just attention-seeking

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 300-400 word LinkedIn contrarian post with a clear position, 3 supporting arguments, and acknowledgment of nuance. Generates comments from both agreement and disagreement.

---

### SM-10: Twitter/X Thread — Educational (10 tweets)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for Twitter/X threads that teach a framework, share research, or break down a complex topic. Threads are the highest-reach format on X and generate follows, retweets, and bookmarks when they deliver genuine value.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Twitter/X thread writer. Write a 10-tweet thread on [TOPIC — e.g., "why most AI-generated marketing copy fails (and the fix)"]. Tweet 1 (hook): promise + tease that makes people want to read the whole thread. Tweets 2-9: one insight, example, or step per tweet — each under 280 characters and able to stand alone. Tweet 10: summary + CTA (follow for more / link to product). Label each tweet by number. No filler tweets.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TOPIC] — a specific, teachable topic with 8-9 distinct points
- [CTA] — follow, link to product, or invite replies

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 10-tweet thread with labeled tweets, each under 280 characters. Hook tweet is strong enough to stop the scroll. Each middle tweet delivers a single standalone insight. Final tweet drives action.

---

### SM-11: Twitter/X Thread — Story Thread

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a narrative thread that tells a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Story threads earn the highest engagement on X because they create suspense — readers follow to find out what happens.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Twitter/X story thread writer. Write a 10-tweet story thread about [STORY — e.g., "how I built a digital product business in 90 days from scratch"]. Tweet 1: hook — the ending or a peak-tension moment that makes readers want to know how. Tweets 2-8: the chronological story — one development per tweet. Tweet 9: the lesson or turning point. Tweet 10: what it means for the reader + CTA. Each tweet under 280 characters.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [STORY] — a genuine personal or business narrative with a beginning, challenge, and resolution
- [TENSION HOOK] — the most compelling moment of the story — put this first

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 10-tweet story thread with a non-chronological hook, sequential story development, a lesson tweet, and a CTA final tweet. Each tweet under 280 characters and readable standalone.

---

### SM-12: Twitter/X Single Tweet — Viral Hook

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a single high-impact tweet designed to generate retweets and engagement. Single viral tweets work best when they compress a complex truth into one unforgettable sentence.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a tweet copywriter. Write 5 tweet variants for [THEME — e.g., "the value of structured AI prompts for marketers"]. Types: (1) contrarian take, (2) specific number/statistic, (3) "hot take" format, (4) two-line poem or parallel structure, (5) question format. Each under 280 characters. No hashtags. No emoji unless it serves the tweet. Label each variant by type.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [THEME] — your core message or expertise area
- Pick the variant that feels most authentic to your voice

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
5 tweet variants (under 280 characters each) across 5 formats: contrarian, stat, hot take, parallel structure, question. Labeled by format. Each is distinct and independently shareable.

---

### SM-13: TikTok Script — Hook-Value-CTA (60 seconds)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for TikTok videos that educate or demonstrate. TikTok's algorithm rewards completion rate — videos that hold attention to the end. Structure is: hook that creates curiosity, fast-paced value delivery, payoff at the end.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a TikTok scriptwriter. Write a 60-second TikTok script for [TOPIC — e.g., "a live demo of generating a Facebook ad using an AI prompt"].

---

### SM-14: TikTok Script — "Point of View" Format

**CONTEXT:**
Use for TikTok POV videos where the creator speaks to the camera as if the viewer is in a specific situation. POV format creates immediate identification and is one of TikTok's most shareable formats.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a TikTok POV script writer. Write a TikTok script in the "POV: you're [SITUATION]" format for [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Situation: [POV SITUATION — e.g., "POV: you're a freelancer who just landed a new client and has 24 hours to write their whole onboarding sequence"].

---

### SM-15: Pinterest Description — Product Pin

---

### SM-16: Pinterest Description — Blog Post / Article Pin

---

### SM-17: Facebook Page Post — Community Engagement

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Facebook community post writer. Write an organic Facebook post for [BRAND PAGE NAME] that drives comments on [TOPIC — e.g., "how your audience uses AI for their marketing"]. Format: share a relatable observation or question, give your own take in 2-3 sentences, end with a specific, easy-to-answer question. Under 150 words.

---

### SM-19: Instagram Story Sequence — 5 Slides (Poll + Swipe Up)

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn brand humanization writer. Write a "meet the person behind [BRAND NAME]" LinkedIn post. Structure: (1) one surprising or specific personal detail that makes the founder/team member relatable, (2) their expertise and background in 2-3 sentences, (3) what drives them in this work, (4) an invitation to connect. Total: 200-300 words. First-person voice. Genuine — not a PR bio.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

- [PERSONAL DETAIL] — something genuine and unexpected that humanizes the person
- [EXPERTISE] — their relevant background without overselling it

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

---

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product launch tweet writer. Write 3 tweet variants announcing the launch of [PRODUCT NAME]. Variant 1: lead with the outcome/result. Variant 2: lead with the most surprising or unexpected feature. Variant 3: lead with the price or offer as the hook. Each tweet: under 280 characters. Include link placeholder [URL].

Structure: (1) name the trend clearly, (2) your take — what it really means (not surface analysis), (3) what smart marketers are doing differently as a result, (4) optional: how [PRODUCT NAME] addresses this specifically. Total: 250-350 words. Cite a specific example or data point if possible.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

---

**PROMPT:**
Act as a transformation content writer. Write an Instagram caption for a before/after post showing the transformation achievable with [PRODUCT NAME]. Before: [BEFORE STATE — e.g., "spending 3 hours writing captions that feel generic and get zero saves"]. After: [AFTER STATE — e.g., "30-minute content session, week of posts done, engagement up"].

Use to gather peer recommendations for your profile while providing value to your network. Recommendation requests perform better when framed as a mutual exchange rather than a one-sided ask.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn recommendation request post writer. Write a post that: (1) shares a brief genuine observation about the value of recommendations, (2) makes a specific ask: "If you've worked with me on [CONTEXT], I'd love a recommendation — and I'll write one for you too," (3) gives clear instructions on how to leave one. Under 200 words. Not a template — sounds like a real person.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [CONTEXT] — specific types of work you want recommendations for
- [YOUR EXPERTISE] — e.g., "marketing copy / AI prompt strategy / content strategy"

---

### SM-27: Pinterest Description — How-To Content Pin

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Pinterest how-to content writer. Write a pin description for a how-to guide: "[GUIDE TITLE — e.g., 'How to Write Facebook Ads Using AI Prompts: Step-by-Step']." Description: promise the outcome in sentence 1, briefly name 3-4 steps in sentences 2-3, include [KEYWORD 1] and [KEYWORD 2] naturally. Total: 200-350 characters. Tone: clear and instructional.

### SM-57: Instagram Caption — "Which One Would You Choose" Format

**CONTEXT:**
Use to drive saves and comments through a decision-making prompt. "Which one would you choose?" posts work when the options are genuinely different and the choice reflects the audience's values or preferences.

Act as a decision-prompt Instagram caption writer. Write an Instagram caption presenting two options: Option A: [OPTION A — e.g., "spend 3 hours writing copy yourself"]. Option B: [OPTION B — e.g., "use AI with the right prompts and get done in 20 minutes"]. Brief context on each. Question: "Which one sounds like you right now?" Under 100 words. 3 hashtags.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [OPTION A] — the status quo or the harder path
- [OPTION B] — the better alternative (your product's approach)
- Make the choice genuine — not a rigged comparison

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 90-word Instagram "which would you choose" caption with two distinct options, brief context, a comment-driving question, and 3 hashtags. Reads as curious exploration, not a sales pitch.

### SM-58: LinkedIn Post — "Lessons from a Failure"

**CONTEXT:**
Use to build trust and relatability by sharing a genuine failure or setback. Vulnerability posts on LinkedIn earn the highest comment rates because they're rare and feel authentic in a platform that's often overly polished.

Act as a LinkedIn vulnerability post writer. Write a post about a genuine failure or setback in [AREA — e.g., "launching the first version of my product"]. Structure: (1) state the failure plainly, (2) what you thought would happen, (3) what actually happened, (4) what you did wrong, (5) what you learned and changed. Under 300 words. No forced silver lining — the lesson can be as simple as "I now know what not to do."

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [AREA] — a real professional setback you've experienced
- [FAILURE] — a specific thing that went wrong — not vague "I failed"
- [LESSON] — the actual thing you changed or learned — be specific

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 275-word LinkedIn failure post with 5-point structure (failure/expectation/reality/mistake/lesson). Reads as genuine and specific — not a "fail upward" humblebrag. The failure is real.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 110-word day-in-the-life Instagram caption with one task, one challenge, one win, and a day-relating question. Personal and honest — reads like a journal entry, not content marketing.

**PROMPT:**

Structure: (1) announce briefly, (2) share one specific insight or moment from the interview — the part worth their time, (3) where to listen/read + CTA. Under 200 words.

### SM-65: Instagram Reel Script — Trending Audio Integration

**CONTEXT:**
Use when a trending audio track fits your content style. Trending audio on Instagram dramatically boosts Reel reach — this prompt builds a Reel concept around the audio rather than forcing audio onto existing content.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an Instagram Reel creative director. Write a Reel concept and script using [TRENDING AUDIO — e.g., "a trending motivational speech clip" or "a trending voiceover format"]. Concept: how does the audio's mood/message map to [BRAND/PRODUCT MESSAGE]? Script: 30-60 seconds with [ON-SCREEN TEXT] notes that work with the audio. Text overlays should complement, not compete with, the audio. ~100 spoken words (or text-only if instrumental).

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TRENDING AUDIO] — research actual trending audio before scripting
- [BRAND/PRODUCT MESSAGE] — the core message you're communicating

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 30-60 second Reel script built around trending audio, with on-screen text notes that work with (not against) the audio. Concept explains why this audio fits the message.
