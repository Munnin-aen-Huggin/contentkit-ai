**Subject:** I built something for marketers who hate staring at blank screens

**Body (paste into Kit editor):**

Hi {{subscriber.first_name}},

After working with dozens of marketing teams, I kept seeing the same bottleneck: smart people spending hours on content that should take minutes.

The AI tools existed. The intention was there. But without the right prompts — the ones that actually get usable output — the tools felt like another thing to wrestle with.

So I built ContentKit AI.

**Here's what it is:**

500+ copy-paste prompts across 8 marketing categories — ads, emails, social media, landing pages, SEO content, brand strategy, product launches, and video scripts. Plus four Notion templates: a 30-day calendar, a 90-day calendar, a brand strategy workspace, and a campaign planner.

**Who it's for:**

Solopreneurs, freelancers, and agency owners who need to produce high-quality marketing content fast — without paying $200/month for copywriting subscriptions.

**How it's different from generic AI prompting:**

Every prompt is pre-engineered with the variables that make AI output actually usable: role, audience specificity, tone parameters, and output format. You fill in your details, paste the prompt, and get professional-grade copy in seconds.

**Starter Kit — $147** (200+ prompts, 30-day calendar):

**Full Kit — $499** (500+ prompts, all 4 Notion templates):

## Email 4 (Position 3, ID 9538631)
**Subject:** How one freelancer cut their content time by 70%

**Body (paste into Kit editor):**

Hi {{subscriber.first_name}},

Let me tell you about Marcus — a freelance marketing consultant serving 8 clients at once.

**Before ContentKit:**
- Spent 12–15 hours/week writing client content
- Delivered one email sequence per client per month at best
- Charged $800/month per client — barely profitable at that volume

**After ContentKit:**
- Produces first drafts in 20–30 minutes using the prompt templates
- Delivers 2–3 email sequences, a full month of social content, and ad copy variations monthly
- Raised rates to $1,400/month per client because the output quality improved

Same clients. Same deliverables scope. 70% less writing time. Significantly higher rates.

The shift wasn't his skill — it was his system.

ContentKit gave him a repeatable process: pick the right category, fill in the client variables, generate multiple options, refine the best one. Each deliverable that used to take 3 hours now takes under an hour.

That's the multiplier effect of good prompts.

If you're still producing content the old way — starting from scratch every time — ContentKit is the upgrade your workflow needs.

## Email 5 (Position 4, ID 9538635)
**Subject:** Last chance: Your AI marketing toolkit is waiting

**Body (paste into Kit editor):**

Hi {{subscriber.first_name}},

This is the last email I'll send about ContentKit AI.

If you've been on the fence, here's the honest case:

Every week you spend producing content the hard way is a week of compounding inefficiency. The gap between marketers who have a system and those who don't keeps growing — because the ones with systems produce more, test more, and improve faster.

ContentKit is that system.

**Here's everything you get:**

**Starter Kit — $147:**
- 200+ prompts across ads, email, and social media
- 30-day content calendar (Notion-compatible)
- Lifetime access + free updates
- → https://buy.stripe.com/bJefZi8NU2lgfHc9TG9ws06

**Full Kit — $499 (most popular):**
- 500+ prompts across all 8 marketing categories
- 4 Notion templates (30-day calendar, 90-day calendar, brand strategy workspace, campaign planner)
- Landing page copy prompts, SEO prompts, video scripts, product launch kit
- Everything in Starter, plus everything that scales
- → https://buy.stripe.com/4gM8wQ0ho7FA3Yu1na9ws05

One-time payment. Instant download. 30-day money-back guarantee — if it doesn't save you time and improve your output, email me for a full refund. No questions asked.

This is the last nudge. You've got the lead magnet. You've seen what well-engineered prompts can do. The next step is up to you.
