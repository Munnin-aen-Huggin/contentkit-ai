# AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Starter (200 Prompts)

> **This is the Starter tier.** The Full Kit includes 500+ prompts plus four Notion templates
> (30-Day Content Calendar, 90-Day Content Calendar, Brand Strategy Workspace, Campaign Planner).
> Upgrade at [URL to be added].

## How to Use This Pack

These prompts are engineered to produce specific, usable marketing outputs — not generic drafts you'll throw away. Each prompt specifies a role for the AI, a structural framework (PAS, AIDA, etc.), and clear variables you replace with your own details. The result is copy that actually sounds like it was written for your business.

To use a prompt: copy it, fill in every bracketed variable with your specific information, then paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI writing tool. The more specific your variable inputs, the better your output. Don't leave variables vague — "freelance graphic designer charging $45/hr who works with SaaS startups" will always outperform "designer."

When the output needs refinement, don't start over — append a follow-up instruction like "Make the CTA more urgent" or "Shorten to 3 sentences" or "Rewrite the second paragraph to focus on the fear of missing out." These prompts are starting points for a conversation, not single-shot commands.

## Category 1: Ads (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn)

These prompts cover the full spectrum of paid advertising copy — from Facebook scroll-stopping hooks to Google search headlines to LinkedIn sponsored content.

---

### FB-01: Facebook Ad — PAS Framework (Pain-Agitate-Solution)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when targeting a cold audience who doesn't know your brand. PAS works by identifying a pain point, amplifying the frustration, then positioning your offer as the relief. Best for awareness and consideration campaigns.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a direct-response copywriter specializing in Facebook ads. Write a PAS-framework Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Target audience: [TARGET AUDIENCE — e.g., "freelance graphic designers charging under $50/hr"]. Pain point: [CORE PAIN — e.g., "spending hours on client proposals that never convert"]. Agitate by describing the emotional and financial cost of this problem. Solution: position [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] as the fix. Include a primary text (up to 125 words), a short headline (under 40 characters), and a description (under 30 characters). End with a CTA button label from this list: [Learn More / Shop Now / Sign Up / Get Quote / Download].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "ProposalKit" or "my Canva proposal template pack"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "freelance graphic designers charging under $50/hr"
- [CORE PAIN] — e.g., "spending 3+ hours on proposals that clients ghost"
- [CTA BUTTON] — e.g., "Download"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
Three-part Facebook ad: primary text (pain → agitate → solution, ~100 words), a punchy headline under 40 characters, and a description line under 30 characters. Tone is empathetic but direct.

---

### FB-02: Facebook Ad — AIDA Framework (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for warm audiences who've shown interest in your category but haven't purchased. AIDA moves methodically from grabbing attention to building rational desire to driving action.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a conversion copywriter. Write an AIDA-framework Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. The attention hook must address [ATTENTION HOOK — e.g., a surprising statistic or bold claim]. Interest section: explain what [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] does in one sentence. Desire section: list 3 specific benefits using "you" language. Action: one clear CTA sentence with urgency. Format: primary text (up to 150 words), headline (under 40 characters), and description (under 30 characters).

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit AI prompt pack"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "small business owners running their own social media"
- [ATTENTION HOOK] — e.g., "Most business owners waste 6 hours/week writing captions from scratch"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A four-section Facebook ad (Attention/Interest/Desire/Action) in primary text format (~130 words), plus headline and description. Reads as natural copy, not a formulaic outline.

---

### FB-03: Facebook Ad — Benefit-Driven (Feature → Benefit → Proof)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your product has specific, demonstrable features that translate to clear outcomes. Ideal for product-aware audiences who need to understand value before clicking.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product marketing copywriter. Write a benefit-driven Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. List 3 core features: [FEATURE 1], [FEATURE 2], [FEATURE 3]. For each feature, write: the feature name, the direct benefit to [TARGET AUDIENCE], and one line of social proof or specificity (stat, time saved, result). End with a single CTA sentence. Format: primary text only, under 150 words. Do not use bullet points — write in short punchy paragraphs.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "BrandKit Notion template"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "freelancers onboarding new clients"
- [FEATURE 1/2/3] — e.g., "pre-built brand questionnaire / client portal / invoice tracker"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A flowing paragraph-style Facebook ad (~130 words) that covers three feature-benefit-proof sequences and ends with a clear CTA. No bullet lists — reads like human ad copy.

---

### FB-04: Facebook Retargeting Ad — Abandoned Consideration

**CONTEXT:**
Use for people who visited your sales page or landing page but didn't buy. This audience is warm — they just need a nudge, an objection handled, or a reason to come back now.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a retargeting ad specialist. Write a Facebook retargeting ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting people who visited [LANDING PAGE URL/DESCRIPTION — e.g., "the sales page for my AI prompt pack"] but didn't purchase. Acknowledge that they've seen the product without being creepy. Address the most likely objection: [TOP OBJECTION — e.g., "not sure if it's worth $47"]. Offer a compelling reason to return now: [INCENTIVE — e.g., "limited-time bonus: free email swipe file added to the bundle"]. Primary text under 100 words. Include headline and description.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [LANDING PAGE URL/DESCRIPTION] — e.g., "my prompt pack sales page"
- [TOP OBJECTION] — e.g., "not sure if AI-written copy will sound like me"
- [INCENTIVE] — e.g., "added 50 new prompts this week — same price"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A conversational retargeting ad (~90 words primary text) that acknowledges prior interest, handles one objection, and gives a time-sensitive reason to return. Headline and description included.

---

### FB-05: Facebook Video Ad Script (30 seconds)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when running video ads on Facebook/Instagram. The first 3 seconds determine whether someone keeps watching — this prompt builds that hook first, then delivers the value, then closes.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a video ad scriptwriter. Write a 30-second Facebook/Instagram video ad script for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Structure: Hook (0-3 sec): one sentence that stops the scroll for [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Problem (3-10 sec): state the pain in 1-2 sentences. Solution (10-20 sec): show how [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] solves it — describe what appears on screen. CTA (20-30 sec): tell viewer exactly what to do and why now. Include [VISUAL NOTE] directions in brackets. Tone: [TONE — e.g., "conversational and relatable, not salesy"].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit AI prompts"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "coaches and consultants creating content"
- [TONE] — e.g., "energetic and direct" or "calm and authoritative"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A timestamped 30-second video ad script with on-screen visual notes in brackets, voiceover text, and a clear CTA. Approximately 80-100 spoken words.

---

### FB-06: Facebook Lead Gen Ad — Free Resource Offer

**CONTEXT:**
Use to drive email list signups via Facebook Lead Gen forms. The offer must be clear and specific — vague "free guides" don't convert. This prompt builds copy around a specific lead magnet.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a lead generation copywriter. Write a Facebook Lead Gen ad offering [LEAD MAGNET NAME — e.g., "a free PDF: 5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"]. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Headline must communicate the specific value of the lead magnet in under 40 characters. Primary text (under 125 words): open with the core promise, state who it's for, list 3 specific things they'll get or learn, end with a low-friction CTA ("Grab it free" or "Download now"). Do not use "newsletter" or "subscribe" language.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [LEAD MAGNET NAME] — e.g., "5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "small business owners spending money on freelance copywriters"
- [3 SPECIFIC OUTCOMES] — e.g., "write a homepage headline / draft a launch email / create a week of social posts"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A lead gen ad with headline (under 40 chars), primary text (~110 words), and description line. Tone emphasizes the free value, not the signup act. No spam-trigger language.

---

### FB-07: Facebook Lookalike Audience Ad — Social Proof Driven

**CONTEXT:**
Use for lookalike audience campaigns where the audience doesn't know your brand but is similar to buyers. Social proof (results, numbers, testimonials) builds instant credibility with cold-but-similar audiences.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a social proof copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting a lookalike audience similar to existing customers. Lead with a specific result or testimonial: [SOCIAL PROOF — e.g., "473 marketers used this to cut their content creation time in half"]. Follow with what the product is and who it's for. Include 2 more proof signals (star rating, customer count, specific outcome). End with CTA. Primary text under 125 words, headline under 40 characters.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] — e.g., "312 buyers. 4.9 stars. 'I wrote a month of content in one afternoon.'"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A proof-heavy Facebook ad (~110 words) that leads with credibility, explains the offer clearly, and closes with urgency or social momentum. Headline and description included.

---

### FB-08: Facebook Ad — Urgency/Scarcity (Launch or Sale)

**CONTEXT:**
Use during a product launch window, flash sale, or limited-time offer. Urgency must be specific and believable — "limited time" without a deadline doesn't work.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a launch copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that creates genuine urgency around [DEADLINE/SCARCITY — e.g., "cart closes Friday at midnight" or "price increases from $27 to $47 on March 1"]. Primary text: acknowledge the limited window in the first line, state what they get, state what they lose if they wait, close with CTA. Under 100 words. Include a headline (under 40 chars) that leads with the deadline.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Full Kit"
- [DEADLINE/SCARCITY] — e.g., "launch price of $47 ends Sunday at midnight"
- [WHAT THEY LOSE] — e.g., "price goes up to $97 and the bonus email swipe file disappears"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A ~90-word urgency-driven Facebook ad with deadline in the headline, clear stakes in the body, and a direct CTA. Tone is matter-of-fact, not hype-y.

---

### FB-09: Facebook Ad — Before/After Transformation

**CONTEXT:**
Use for products or services with a clear before/after outcome. Works especially well for productivity tools, courses, templates, and coaching. Visual contrast of states drives desire.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a transformation copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a before/after format. Before state: [BEFORE — e.g., "spending 3 hours writing one email and second-guessing every word"]. After state: [AFTER — e.g., "30-minute email that sounds like you on your best day"]. Bridge: [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] is what gets them from before to after. Include: how it works (one sentence), who it's for, and CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit AI Prompt Pack"
- [BEFORE] — e.g., "posting random content and getting zero engagement"
- [AFTER] — e.g., "publishing a month of strategic content in one afternoon"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A contrast-driven Facebook ad (~110 words) that paints the before state vividly, makes the after state aspirational, and positions the product as the bridge. Headline and description included.

---

### FB-10: Facebook Ad — Question Hook (Curiosity-Led)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your target audience has a burning question they haven't found a good answer to. Question-led ads drive high CTR because the viewer feels the ad is for them specifically.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a curiosity-driven copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that opens with a provocative question your [TARGET AUDIENCE] is secretly asking themselves: [QUESTION — e.g., "What would you do with 10 extra hours a week?"]. Paragraph 2: empathize with why they're asking. Paragraph 3: introduce [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] as the answer. Paragraph 4: one benefit, one social proof signal, one CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "solopreneurs managing their own marketing"
- [QUESTION] — e.g., "Why does everyone else seem to post content effortlessly?"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A four-paragraph Facebook ad (~110 words) that opens with a resonant question, builds empathy, introduces the solution, and closes with a benefit-CTA. Conversational tone.

---

### FB-11: Facebook Ad — Competitor Comparison (Without Naming Names)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your audience is actively comparing options. You can reference "other solutions" or "subscription tools" without naming competitors — positions your offer as superior on the dimensions that matter to your buyer.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a positioning copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that contrasts it favorably with [CATEGORY OF COMPETITOR — e.g., "monthly subscription copywriting tools"]. Do not name specific competitors. Contrast on: [DIFFERENTIATOR 1 — e.g., "one-time payment vs. monthly fees"], [DIFFERENTIATOR 2 — e.g., "you own the prompts vs. losing access if you cancel"], [DIFFERENTIATOR 3 — e.g., "works with any AI tool vs. locked to one platform"]. End with CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [CATEGORY OF COMPETITOR] — e.g., "AI writing subscriptions charging $49/month"
- [DIFFERENTIATOR 1/2/3] — Your three strongest advantages

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A comparison-style Facebook ad (~110 words) that positions your offer as the smarter choice without attack-style language. Tone is confident and matter-of-fact.

---

### FB-12: Facebook Ad — Story Format (Personal Narrative)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when you want to build connection and trust before the pitch. Story ads have lower immediate CTR but higher engagement and purchase rates from warm audiences. Best used after initial awareness campaigns.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a storytelling copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a personal narrative structure. Story: [CHARACTER — e.g., "a freelancer"] faced [PROBLEM]. They tried [FAILED SOLUTION]. Then they found [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Result: [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]. Lesson: one sentence that makes the reader see themselves in the story. CTA: invite them to get the same result. Primary text 150-200 words. First-person or third-person voice: [VOICE].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"

- [SPECIFIC OUTCOME] — e.g., "cut content creation from 6 hours to 45 minutes a week"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 150-200 word narrative Facebook ad with a clear story arc (problem → failed solution → discovery → result) and a CTA that invites the reader into the same transformation.

---

### FB-13: Facebook Ad — Objection Crusher

**CONTEXT:**
Use for audiences who've been exposed to your offer but haven't converted. This ad format directly names the objection and demolishes it before asking for the click.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an objection-handling copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting people who have the objection: "[OBJECTION — e.g., 'AI copy doesn't sound like me']". Open by naming the objection directly. Then systematically dismantle it with: [COUNTERPOINT 1], [COUNTERPOINT 2], and [SOCIAL PROOF OR EXAMPLE]. Close with a low-risk CTA that reduces perceived risk: [LOW-RISK CTA — e.g., "Try one prompt free before you buy"]. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [OBJECTION] — e.g., "I'm not technical enough to use AI prompts"

- [LOW-RISK CTA] — e.g., "Download 5 free prompts and see for yourself"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 110-word objection-busting Facebook ad that opens with the named objection, provides a two-step logical rebuttal, and closes with a risk-reducing CTA.

---

### FB-14: Facebook Ad — Price Anchor (Justify the Investment)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your product has a price point that feels high relative to competing free options. Anchoring against the cost of alternatives (freelancers, subscriptions, time) reframes price as a bargain.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a price-justification copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] priced at [PRICE — e.g., "$47"]. Anchor the price against: [ALTERNATIVE 1 COST — e.g., "hiring a copywriter: $500+ per project"] and [ALTERNATIVE 2 COST — e.g., "Jasper subscription: $49/month = $588/year"]. Show the math explicitly. Then state what [PRICE] actually gets them. CTA must mention the price to qualify buyers. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Full Kit"
- [PRICE] — e.g., "$47 one-time"
- [ALTERNATIVE 1 COST] — e.g., "a freelance copywriter charges $150-500 per ad"
- [ALTERNATIVE 2 COST] — e.g., "$49/month AI tools = $588/year"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A price-anchoring Facebook ad (~110 words) that makes $47 (or your price) feel like an obvious no-brainer by contrast with real alternatives. Headline includes the price.

---

### FB-15: Facebook Ad — Social Currency ("What Buyers Are Saying")

**CONTEXT:**
Use user-generated quote-style social proof to make an ad feel like a peer recommendation rather than brand messaging. Works best when you have real testimonial language to draw from.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a testimonial ad copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] that opens with a paraphrased or real customer quote: "[TESTIMONIAL QUOTE — e.g., 'I wrote a week of content in 20 minutes. This thing is stupid easy.']". Follow with: who said it ([BUYER PERSONA — e.g., "freelance marketer, 3 years experience"]), what they used the product for, and 2 more supporting proof points. CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [TESTIMONIAL QUOTE] — Use a real quote or write a plausible representative one
- [BUYER PERSONA] — e.g., "agency owner managing 5 client accounts"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A testimonial-led Facebook ad (~110 words) that opens with a customer voice, grounds it with persona detail, and layers in additional social proof before the CTA.

### LI-01: LinkedIn Sponsored Content Ad — Thought Leadership

**CONTEXT:**
Use for LinkedIn campaigns targeting B2B audiences. LinkedIn users respond to insight and expertise, not hard sells. This prompt leads with a valuable insight, then naturally introduces your product.

**PROMPT:**

---

### LI-02: LinkedIn Lead Gen Form Ad — Gated Resource

**CONTEXT:**
Use to drive LinkedIn Lead Gen Form submissions (name + email pre-filled from profile). Offer must have high perceived professional value — whitepapers, templates, and toolkits work better than "free guides."

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn lead gen copywriter. Write an ad promoting [LEAD MAGNET NAME — e.g., "The AI Marketing Toolkit: 5 Prompts for Better Campaign Copy"]. Target: [JOB TITLE/AUDIENCE]. Headline (70 chars max): state the specific value.

---

### LI-03: LinkedIn InMail — Cold Outreach for Digital Product

**CONTEXT:**
Use for LinkedIn Sponsored InMail targeting professionals who match your ICP. InMail must feel personally written — mass-blast language kills response rates. Keep it short and make the ask small.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn InMail copywriter. Write a sponsored InMail for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting [JOB TITLE — e.g., "marketing consultants running their own practice"]. Subject line (60 chars max): make it feel personal and relevant. Body (300 words max): reference something specific about their role, identify the problem [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] solves for people in their position, describe the offer in 2 sentences, and make the ask: [SMALL ASK — e.g., "Would it be useful?

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A LinkedIn InMail with subject line (under 60 chars) and body (under 300 words) that reads as a personal message, not a sales blast. Soft close with a small, specific ask.

---

### LI-04: LinkedIn Text Ad — Compact B2B

Act as a LinkedIn Text Ad copywriter. Write 3 variants of LinkedIn Text Ads for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting [AUDIENCE]. Each variant: headline (25 chars max), description (75 chars max). Variant 1: benefit-led. Variant 2: problem-led. Variant 3: social proof-led. Label each variant and provide character counts.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [AUDIENCE] — e.g., "marketing consultants and agency owners"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
Three LinkedIn Text Ad variants, each with headline and description. Labeled by approach (benefit/problem/proof) with character counts confirmed. Ready for direct upload.

### LI-05: LinkedIn Single Image Ad — Case Study Format

**CONTEXT:**
Use when you have a specific result or outcome to highlight. Case study format (before → after → how) outperforms generic benefit claims on LinkedIn because it shows evidence, not assertion.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn case study ad writer. Write a LinkedIn Single Image Ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] structured as a micro case study. Subject: [CUSTOMER TYPE — e.g., "a freelance marketer"]. Problem they had: [PROBLEM]. What they used: [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Specific result: [RESULT — e.g., "cut content creation time by 70% in week one"]. Primary text (150 words): tell the story in third person. Headline (70 chars): state the result. CTA: [CTA — e.g., "Get the same result"].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [CUSTOMER TYPE] — e.g., "an agency owner managing 8 clients"
- [PROBLEM] — e.g., "spending 10+ hours/week writing ad copy from scratch"
- [RESULT] — e.g., "cut ad creation time by 65%, increased CTR by 40%"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 150-word LinkedIn case study ad in primary text, plus a result-led headline (70 chars) and CTA. Tone is factual and outcome-focused, not hype-driven.

## Category 2: Emails

Welcome sequences, abandoned cart, re-engagement, promotional, nurture, cold outreach — this category covers every email type in a full marketing funnel. Each prompt builds a complete email, not a template with blanks to fill.

---

### EM-01: Welcome Email — Single-Product Purchase

**CONTEXT:**
Use immediately after a customer purchases your product. The post-purchase welcome email has the highest open rate of any email in your sequence — this is your chance to confirm the decision, set expectations, and begin building a relationship.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a customer success email writer. Write a post-purchase welcome email for a buyer of [PRODUCT NAME]. Subject line: confirm their great decision without being sycophantic. Body structure: (1) delivery confirmation — where to find [PRODUCT NAME], (2) quick-start instruction — the one thing to do first, (3) set expectations for what's inside, (4) invite them to reply with questions.

A welcome email with subject line, preview text, and body (~180 words). Warm and functional — confirms purchase, delivers access, sets next action clearly.

---

### EM-02: Welcome Sequence Email 2 — "How to Get Results Fast"

**CONTEXT:**
Send 24-48 hours after purchase. Most buyers don't use products they buy within the first 48 hours — this email activates them by giving a specific, simple action that produces an immediate result.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product activation email writer. Write a Day 2 welcome sequence email for [PRODUCT NAME] buyers. Goal: get them to use the product and get one quick win before they forget about it. Structure: (1) acknowledge they just bought, (2) give them one specific, easy action to take in 10 minutes, (3) tell them exactly what result they'll get from that action, (4) soft CTA to reply with their result. Under 200 words. Subject line must create urgency without being spammy.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [QUICK WIN ACTION] — e.g., "open the Ads category, grab prompt FB-01, paste it in ChatGPT with your product details"
- [RESULT] — e.g., "you'll have a ready-to-test Facebook ad in under 5 minutes"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A Day 2 activation email (~175 words) with subject line, preview text, and body. Focused on getting the buyer one specific quick win that proves product value.

---

### EM-03: Welcome Sequence Email 3 — Social Proof + Upsell

**CONTEXT:**
Send Day 4-5 of welcome sequence. By now the buyer has used the product at least once. This email reinforces their decision with social proof and makes a soft, natural upsell to the next tier.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a retention and upsell email writer. Write a Day 5 email for [LOWER-TIER PRODUCT] buyers. Structure: (1) ask if they've tried the product yet — share a relatable buyer experience, (2) share 2-3 buyer results (paraphrased or representative testimonials), (3) soft mention that buyers who upgrade to [UPPER-TIER PRODUCT] get [UPGRADE BENEFIT — e.g., "300 more prompts + 4 Notion templates"], (4) upgrade CTA (not pushy — "if you want more"). Under 250 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [LOWER-TIER PRODUCT] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Starter"
- [UPPER-TIER PRODUCT] — e.g., "Full Kit"
- [UPGRADE BENEFIT] — e.g., "300 more prompts, 4 Notion templates, and video script category"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A Day 5 social proof + soft upsell email (~225 words) with subject line and body. Reads like a helpful follow-up, not a sales pitch. Upsell is mentioned but not pushed.

---

### EM-04: Abandoned Cart Email 1 — Reminder (Soft)

**CONTEXT:**
Send 1-2 hours after cart abandonment. The first abandoned cart email should be a gentle, no-pressure reminder — they may have simply gotten distracted. No urgency tactics yet.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an abandoned cart email specialist. Write a soft abandoned cart email for [PRODUCT NAME] priced at [PRICE]. The buyer added to cart but didn't complete purchase. Tone: friendly and helpful, as if they left something behind by mistake. Body: (1) remind them what's in their cart with 2 key benefits, (2) make completing the purchase frictionless with a direct link, (3) offer to answer questions (reply or support email). No urgency language. Under 150 words. Include subject line.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Full Kit"
- [PRICE] — e.g., "$47"
- [2 KEY BENEFITS] — e.g., "500+ prompts across 8 categories / works with any AI tool"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A soft cart abandonment email (~130 words) with subject line and body. No urgency tactics — just a helpful reminder with a direct link back to cart. Conversational tone.

---

### EM-05: Abandoned Cart Email 2 — Objection Handler

**CONTEXT:**
Send 24 hours after first abandonment email. This email handles the most likely reason they didn't buy — without being presumptuous. Name the objection directly and dissolve it.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an objection-handling email copywriter. Write a second abandoned cart email for [PRODUCT NAME]. It's been 24 hours since they added to cart. This email must address the most likely objection: [MOST LIKELY OBJECTION — e.g., "not sure if AI prompts will sound like my brand"]. Acknowledge the hesitation with empathy. Provide specific counterpoint. End with return-to-cart CTA and a brief guarantee mention. Under 200 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [MOST LIKELY OBJECTION] — e.g., "wondering if they'll actually use it"
- [COUNTERPOINT] — e.g., "the prompts are fill-in-the-blank — not AI guesswork"
- [GUARANTEE] — e.g., "30-day money-back guarantee"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 175-word second cart abandonment email with subject line that handles one specific objection and closes with a risk-reduced CTA. Empathetic, not pressuring.

---

### EM-06: Abandoned Cart Email 3 — Final Urgency

**CONTEXT:**
Send 48-72 hours after abandonment. Final email in the cart sequence. Now you can apply urgency — either a deadline, a price reminder, or a "last chance" framing. Be direct about it.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a cart recovery urgency email writer. Write a final abandoned cart email for [PRODUCT NAME]. Urgency mechanism: [URGENCY — e.g., "launch price of $47 ends Friday at midnight" or "we're removing the bonus in 24 hours"]. Subject line: lead with the deadline. Body: state what they're about to miss, give them a direct path back to purchase, end with a clear expiry statement. Under 150 words. No soft language — this is the last email in the sequence.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [URGENCY] — e.g., "price increases to $67 at midnight tonight"
- [WHAT THEY LOSE] — e.g., "the early-buyer price and the bonus email swipe file"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A final cart abandonment email (~130 words) with a deadline-led subject line and direct, urgent body copy. Last call tone — no apologies, clear deadline, direct CTA.

---

### EM-07: Welcome Email — Lead Magnet Delivery

**CONTEXT:**
Use immediately when someone downloads your free lead magnet. This email delivers the resource, introduces the brand, and plants the seed for the paid product — without pitching too early.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a lead magnet delivery email writer. Write the delivery email for [LEAD MAGNET NAME — e.g., "5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"]. Structure: (1) deliver the resource immediately (link or attachment), (2) one sentence on how to use it for maximum value, (3) brief brand introduction — who you are and what you do, (4) tease what's coming next in the email sequence (not a sales pitch yet). Under 175 words. Warm, no-pressure tone.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [LEAD MAGNET NAME] — e.g., "5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"
- [DOWNLOAD LINK/ATTACHMENT] — add your actual download URL
- [BRAND INTRO] — e.g., "I build tools that help marketers work smarter with AI"
- [TEASE] — e.g., "tomorrow I'll send you the #1 prompt type that gets results every time"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A lead magnet delivery email (~160 words) with subject line and body. Delivers the resource immediately, introduces brand lightly, and teases email #2 without selling.

---

### EM-08: Nurture Email 1 — Education (Teach, Don't Sell)

**CONTEXT:**
Send Day 2-3 of lead magnet nurture sequence. The goal is to deliver standalone value — teach something useful — while subtly establishing that you know what you're talking about. No sales pitch in this email.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an educational email writer. Write a nurture email that teaches [TOPIC — e.g., "why most AI marketing prompts fail (and what to do instead)"]. Teach the lesson in 250-300 words: (1) name the common mistake, (2) explain why it happens, (3) give a specific fix, (4) optional: connect to your product in one final sentence only. Subject line should promise the lesson, not tease the product. No CTA to buy.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TOPIC] — e.g., "the one structural mistake that makes AI-written copy sound robotic"
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit" (mention once, at end, optionally)

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 250-300 word educational nurture email with subject line. Standalone value — reader benefits from opening this whether they ever buy or not. Product mentioned at most once and not promotionally.

---

### EM-09: Nurture Email 2 — Case Study / Mini Story

**CONTEXT:**
Send Day 4-5 of nurture sequence. Stories convert better than facts because they create identification — readers project themselves into the character's situation. Use a buyer story to show transformation.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a story-driven email writer. Write a nurture email featuring a mini case study for [PRODUCT NAME]. Character: [BUYER TYPE — e.g., "a freelance marketer managing 4 client accounts"]. Problem they had. What they tried that didn't work. Discovery of [PRODUCT NAME]. One specific result. Lesson for the reader. Under 300 words. Soft CTA at end: invite reader to try [PRODUCT NAME] if they recognize themselves in the story.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [BUYER TYPE] — e.g., "a solopreneur building a personal brand"
- [SPECIFIC RESULT] — e.g., "wrote a month of social content in 90 minutes"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 275-word narrative nurture email with subject line. Tells a complete buyer transformation story with a soft product CTA. Reads like a genuine account, not a testimonial quote.

---

### EM-10: Nurture Email 3 — Social Proof Roundup

**CONTEXT:**
Send Day 6-7 of nurture sequence. After delivering value and telling a story, show breadth of social proof — different buyer types, different use cases, different outcomes. Builds confidence across audience segments.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a social proof email writer. Write a nurture email titled something like "Here's what [NUMBER] buyers are saying about [PRODUCT NAME]." Feature 4-5 short representative quotes from different buyer types: [BUYER TYPE 1], [BUYER TYPE 2], [BUYER TYPE 3], [BUYER TYPE 4]. Each quote: 2 sentences, specific outcome, attributed to buyer type. After quotes: one-paragraph synthesis. CTA: invite reader to try it with guarantee mentioned. Under 300 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [NUMBER] — e.g., "400+" — use real numbers
- [BUYER TYPES] — e.g., "freelancer / agency owner / coach / startup marketer"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 275-word social proof email with subject line featuring 4-5 attributed quotes from diverse buyer types and a guarantee-backed CTA. Reads as evidence, not marketing.

---

### EM-11: Nurture Email 4 — Objection FAQ

**CONTEXT:**
Send Day 8-9 of nurture sequence. By now subscribers have received value but haven't purchased. Address the top 3 objections directly in a FAQ format — removes decision friction without being pushy.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an FAQ email writer. Write a nurture email that addresses the top 3 purchase objections for [PRODUCT NAME] in Q&A format. Objection 1: [OBJECTION 1 — e.g., "I'm not sure I'll actually use it"]. Objection 2: [OBJECTION 2 — e.g., "I don't know if AI copy will sound like me"]. Objection 3: [OBJECTION 3 — e.g., "Is $47 really worth it?"]. Answer each honestly and specifically — don't dismiss the concern, resolve it. CTA with guarantee at end. Under 350 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [OBJECTION 1/2/3] — use actual objections from your audience (sales page comments, direct replies, etc.)

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 325-word FAQ-style nurture email with 3 honest objection responses and a risk-reversed CTA. Tone is transparent and direct — reads as authentic problem-solving, not sales spin.

---

### EM-12: Nurture Email 5 — Final Ask (Last Chance)

**CONTEXT:**
Send Day 10-12 of nurture sequence. Final promotional email. Be direct about the ask — by now the reader knows who you are and what you sell. A clear, honest final ask outperforms another value email.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a closing email copywriter. Write the final promotional email in a nurture sequence for [PRODUCT NAME]. This is the last pitch email. Be direct: acknowledge they've received several emails, say you won't keep selling this, and make the final case clearly. Include: what they get, the price, the guarantee, and a direct CTA. Any final urgency: [URGENCY — e.g., "price increases at end of this week" or "no urgency — just making the final ask"]. Under 250 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [URGENCY] — e.g., "price stays at $47 this week — I may raise it after the launch period"

---

### EM-13: Promotional Email — Flash Sale

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a 48-72 hour flash sale to an existing email list. Primes buyers with a specific discount or bonus, creates urgency with a hard deadline. Works best sent to non-buyers on your list.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a flash sale email copywriter. Write a flash sale announcement email for [PRODUCT NAME]. Sale details: [DISCOUNT OR BONUS — e.g., "30% off" or "buy Full Kit, get email swipe file free"]. Duration: [DURATION — e.g., "48 hours — ends [DAY] at midnight"]. Structure: (1) announce the sale clearly in subject line and first line, (2) remind them what [PRODUCT NAME] is and does, (3) state the sale terms explicitly, (4) CTA with countdown language. Under 200 words. Subject line must include the sale term.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product update email writer. Write an update announcement email for [PRODUCT NAME]. What's new: [UPDATE — e.g., "100 new prompts added across 3 categories + new video scripts section"]. For existing buyers: how to access the update (if applicable). For non-buyers: frame the update as an expanded offer at the same price. CTA: invite non-buyers to get everything now.

- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [UPDATE] — e.g., "Added: 50 new video script prompts, 30 new SEO prompts, and a brand new Email category"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 200-word product update email that rewards existing buyers and creates a fresh purchase trigger for non-buyers. Subject leads with the new content, not housekeeping language.

---

### EM-15: Promotional Email — Re-Engagement (Inactive Subscribers)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for subscribers who haven't opened in 60-90 days. The goal is to either re-engage them or identify them for list cleaning. Be direct about the re-engagement ask — vague "we miss you" emails don't work.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a re-engagement email specialist. Write a re-engagement email for [BRAND NAME] subscribers who haven't opened in 60+ days. Format: (1) acknowledge directly ("You haven't heard from us in a while — that's fair"), (2) give them a specific reason to stay on the list, (3) offer something of value to re-engage: [RE-ENGAGEMENT OFFER — e.g., "free prompt sample PDF"], (4) include a "stay subscribed" CTA and a "unsubscribe" link explicitly offered.

---

### EM-16: Cold Outreach Email — B2B Prospecting

**CONTEXT:**
Use for cold email outreach to a list of qualified prospects. The goal is not to sell — it's to start a conversation. Most cold emails fail because they lead with the pitch. Lead with the prospect's problem.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a B2B cold email specialist. Write a cold outreach email for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting [TARGET COMPANY TYPE — e.g., "marketing agencies with 5-15 employees"]. Subject line: reference something specific about their role or company type. Body (150 words max): (1) one sentence on who you are, (2) identify a specific problem they likely have, (3) one sentence on what [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] does about it, (4) one specific result or proof, (5) small ask: [ASK — e.g., "Is this relevant to your team?

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 140-word cold email with subject line and body. Leads with prospect problem, not product pitch. Ends with a small, easy ask — not a calendar link or full pitch.

---

### EM-17: Cold Outreach Email — Follow-Up Sequence (3 emails)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the 2nd and 3rd follow-up emails in a cold outreach sequence. Most cold email replies come from follow-ups, not the initial email. Each follow-up must add new value, not just ask "did you see my last email?"

**PROMPT:**
Act as a cold email follow-up specialist. Write a 3-email follow-up sequence following a cold email for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Email 1 (Day 3): add one new piece of value — a specific insight, stat, or result from a similar company type. Email 2 (Day 7): try a different angle — address a different pain point than the original email. Email 3 (Day 14): polite final ask — acknowledge this is the last email, make it easy to reply even with a "not now." Each email: under 100 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [NEW VALUE — Email 1] — e.g., a specific result from your customer data
- [DIFFERENT PAIN — Email 2] — e.g., if original was about time, try quality or cost

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
Three follow-up emails (under 100 words each) with subject lines that don't start with "Re:" or "Following up." Each adds new value or a new angle, not just a repetition of the original ask.

---

### EM-18: Referral Request Email — Existing Buyers

**CONTEXT:**
Use to activate word-of-mouth from satisfied buyers. Best sent 7-14 days after purchase when buyers have used the product and formed an opinion. Referral emails work when they make sharing easy and specific.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a referral program email writer. Write an email to existing buyers of [PRODUCT NAME] asking for a referral. Tone: warm and appreciative. Structure: (1) brief appreciation for their purchase, (2) ask if they know someone who would benefit, (3) make sharing easy: provide a pre-written message they can forward or a link they can share, (4) optional incentive: [INCENTIVE — e.g., "they get $5 off with your link" or "no incentive — just asking"]. Under 200 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PRE-WRITTEN MESSAGE] — e.g., "Hey — I've been using this AI prompt kit for my marketing. It's actually saved me hours. Here's the link if you want to check it out: [URL]"
- [INCENTIVE] — optional — describe or remove

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 175-word referral request email with subject line that makes sharing feel natural and easy. Includes a pre-written shareable message. Not transactional — feels like a genuine ask between peers.

---

### EM-19: Email Subject Line Battery — 20 Variants

Act as a subject line specialist. Write 20 email subject line variants for a promotional email about [PRODUCT NAME — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit launch"]. Generate 4 variants each of 5 types: (1) curiosity-gap, (2) direct benefit, (3) urgency/deadline, (4) social proof, (5) question. Each subject line under 50 characters. Label by type and number.

- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [LAUNCH CONTEXT] — e.g., "launch week" or "new version release" or "flash sale"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
20 subject lines in a labeled table: type, number, subject line text, character count. All under 50 characters. Variety in structure and trigger — no two feel identical.

---

### EM-20: Preview Text Optimizations — 10 Variants

**CONTEXT:**
Preview text (the snippet after the subject line in the inbox) dramatically affects open rates. It should complete the subject line's thought, not repeat it. This prompt generates preview text paired with a given subject line.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an inbox optimization specialist. Write 10 preview text variants to pair with this subject line: "[SUBJECT LINE — e.g., 'You left something in your cart']." Preview text requirements: (1) extends or contrasts the subject line — doesn't repeat it, (2) under 90 characters, (3) ends mid-thought if possible (creates curiosity). Generate 10 variants with different tones: 2 urgent, 2 curious, 2 benefit-focused, 2 social proof, 2 direct. Label each by tone.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [SUBJECT LINE] — paste your actual subject line
- Adjust tone labels to match your brand voice

---

### EM-22: Email — Customer Milestone / Win

**CONTEXT:**
Use to celebrate a customer milestone — when they've used the product for 30 days, achieved a result, or hit a usage trigger. Celebration emails improve retention and generate testimonial opportunities.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a customer success email writer. Write a 30-day milestone email for [PRODUCT NAME] customers. Structure: (1) celebrate the milestone with a specific acknowledgment, (2) ask what result they've achieved so far, (3) share one underused feature or tip they may have missed, (4) invite them to share their result (for social proof), (5) if applicable, mention the upgrade path.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 200-word milestone email with subject line that feels genuinely celebratory and drives engagement through a question, a tip, and a social proof invitation. Not a sales email.

---

### EM-23: Email — Product Review / Testimonial Request

**CONTEXT:**
Use 14-21 days post-purchase to collect reviews and testimonials. The best testimonial requests make it easy to respond by asking a specific question rather than "leave a review."

**PROMPT:**
Act as a testimonial collection email writer. Write an email requesting feedback from buyers of [PRODUCT NAME]. Subject: curiosity-gap — don't say "review request." Body: (1) acknowledge they've had the product 2 weeks, (2) ask one specific question: "[SPECIFIC QUESTION — e.g., 'What's one marketing task you used the kit for in the last 2 weeks?']", (3) explain how their answer helps future buyers, (4) optional incentive for responding: [INCENTIVE — e.g., "bonus: reply and I'll send you 5 additional prompts"].

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 160-word testimonial request email with curiosity-gap subject line and a single specific question. Makes responding easy by asking something concrete, not generic.

---

**PROMPT:**
Act as a subscriber loyalty email writer. Write a subscriber-exclusive offer email for [PRODUCT NAME]. The offer is "available only to subscribers, not advertised publicly."

## Category 3: Social Media

Instagram captions, LinkedIn posts, Twitter/X threads, TikTok scripts, Pinterest descriptions, carousel copy — this category covers every major platform and format. Each prompt is platform-specific and built for the content type that performs best on each channel.

---

### SM-01: Instagram Caption — Educational Carousel (Hook + Swipe + CTA)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for Instagram carousel posts that teach something in 5-10 slides. The caption introduces the topic and hooks the reader into swiping. Carousels have the highest average reach of any Instagram format.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an Instagram content strategist. Write an Instagram carousel caption for a post teaching [TOPIC — e.g., "how to write Facebook ads using the PAS framework"]. Caption structure: Hook (first line — must stop the scroll and promise value), 1-2 sentences expanding on what they'll learn, CTA to swipe. Under 100 words. The first line is the most important — it must work as a standalone scroll-stopper. Also suggest 5 slide titles for the carousel.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TOPIC] — e.g., "3 AI prompt structures that write better ads than most copywriters"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "small business owners writing their own ads"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
An Instagram carousel caption under 100 words with a hook-first structure and swipe CTA, plus 5 suggested carousel slide titles. Ready to pair with designed slides.

---

### SM-02: Instagram Caption — Product Feature (Single Image)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a single-image product post on Instagram. The caption must work without the visual — assume the image shows the product, so the caption sells the benefit and context.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an Instagram product copywriter. Write a single-image Instagram product caption for [PRODUCT NAME]. Structure: (1) open with a benefit statement, not the product name, (2) 2-3 sentences expanding on who it's for and what they get, (3) social proof line (one number or quote), (4) CTA with link-in-bio instruction. Under 125 words. Use line breaks for readability. Include 5 relevant hashtags at the end.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [BENEFIT] — e.g., "write a month of marketing copy in one afternoon"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] — e.g., "500+ marketers use this" or "4.9 stars"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 110-word Instagram product caption with line breaks, benefit-first structure, social proof, CTA, and 5 hashtags. Reads as natural Instagram content, not an ad.

---

### SM-03: Instagram Caption — Personal Story / Relatable Moment

**CONTEXT:**
Use for organic engagement content that builds connection. Relatable story posts perform well when they describe a specific situation your audience recognizes from their own experience.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an Instagram storytelling copywriter. Write an Instagram caption in the personal story format for [NICHE/AUDIENCE — e.g., "freelance marketers"]. Story: describe a specific, relatable moment: [RELATABLE MOMENT — e.g., "that moment when a client asks for 'just a quick email' and it turns into a 3-hour project"]. Develop the moment in 2-3 sentences. End with a question that invites comments. Under 125 words. Conversational voice — first person, natural, no corporate tone.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [NICHE/AUDIENCE] — e.g., "solopreneurs managing their own content"
- [RELATABLE MOMENT] — describe a situation your audience will recognize immediately

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 110-word first-person Instagram caption with a relatable story, brief development, and an engagement-driving question at the end. Reads like a real person's post.

---

### SM-04: Instagram Reel Script — 30-Second Value Hook

**CONTEXT:**
Use for Instagram Reels (30 seconds or less). Reels scripts need a hook in the first 2 seconds, a value delivery in the middle, and a clear CTA at the end. This prompt generates a complete script with on-screen text notes.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Reels script writer. Write a 30-second Instagram Reel script for [TOPIC — e.g., "how to write a Facebook ad using AI in 5 minutes"]. Structure: Hook (0-2 sec): on-screen text + voiceover hook that makes someone stop mid-scroll. Value (2-22 sec): deliver 3 quick tips or steps with on-screen text labels. CTA (22-30 sec): tell them what to do next. Include [ON-SCREEN TEXT] notes in brackets. Total spoken words: 80-100.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TOPIC] — a specific marketing tip or how-to that your audience cares about
- [ON-SCREEN TEXT] — note what text appears on screen at each moment

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A timestamped 30-second Reel script with on-screen text in brackets, voiceover text, and CTA. ~85 spoken words. Ready to film from the script.

---

### SM-05: Instagram Reel Script — Product Demo (60 seconds)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a product demonstration Reel that shows (not tells) how the product works. Show-don't-tell demos convert better than feature lists because viewers can see the value before buying.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product demo Reel scriptwriter. Write a 60-second Instagram Reel script demonstrating [PRODUCT NAME] in action. Structure: Hook (0-3 sec): bold problem or result statement. Setup (3-10 sec): who this is for and what they're about to see. Demo (10-50 sec): show the product being used — describe what appears on screen step by step. Reveal (50-55 sec): the result. CTA (55-60 sec): where to get it. Include [SCREEN NOTE] directions.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [DEMO STEPS] — describe the actual product experience you're demonstrating

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A timestamped 60-second Reel script with screen notes, voiceover, and CTA. Approximately 150 spoken words. Structured to let the product demo do the selling.

---

### SM-06: LinkedIn Post — Thought Leadership (Long-Form)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a high-engagement LinkedIn post that positions you as an expert. LinkedIn's algorithm rewards posts that generate comments — so every thought leadership post should end with a discussion-starting question.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn thought leadership writer. Write a long-form LinkedIn post on [TOPIC — e.g., "why AI prompt quality matters more than the AI model you use"]. Structure: opening hook (one strong statement or counterintuitive claim), main insight developed in 3-4 short paragraphs, one specific example, key takeaway, discussion question. Total: 300-400 words. Use short paragraphs (1-3 sentences each) for mobile readability. No bullet points — flowing prose only.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TOPIC] — a genuine insight in your area of expertise
- [SPECIFIC EXAMPLE] — a concrete, real example that illustrates the main point

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 300-400 word LinkedIn post with a strong opening hook, flowing argument, concrete example, and an engagement-driving final question. Short paragraphs optimized for mobile.

---

### SM-07: LinkedIn Post — Tactical How-To

**CONTEXT:**
Use for LinkedIn posts that teach a specific, actionable framework or process. Tactical posts perform well when they give readers something they can implement the same day.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn tactical content writer. Write a LinkedIn post teaching [FRAMEWORK/PROCESS — e.g., "a 4-step framework for writing AI marketing prompts that actually work"]. Structure: Hook (one line promising the framework). Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4 — each with a label and 2 sentences. Closing takeaway: why this matters. Optional: brief mention of [PRODUCT NAME] as the implementation shortcut. Total: 250-350 words. Use numbered steps with brief labels.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [FRAMEWORK/PROCESS] — e.g., "the ROPE framework: Role, Outcome, Parameters, Examples"
- [PRODUCT NAME] — optional mention of your product as the "done-for-you" version

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 250-350 word LinkedIn tactical post with numbered steps, 2-sentence explanations per step, and a closing insight. Actionable enough to implement without buying anything.

---

### SM-08: LinkedIn Post — Personal Win (Humble Brag Done Right)

**CONTEXT:**
Use to share a milestone, result, or win without coming across as self-congratulatory. The key is to make the win about the audience — turn your result into a lesson they can apply.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn achievement post writer. Write a post sharing [WIN/MILESTONE — e.g., "hitting 500 buyers in 90 days"]. Structure: (1) state the win briefly, (2) immediately pivot to what you learned from it or what made it possible, (3) turn the lesson into a takeaway for your audience, (4) optional: brief mention of relevant product or resource. Total: 200-300 words. Tone: genuine and lesson-focused, not victory lap.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [WIN/MILESTONE] — e.g., "500 buyers / first $10K month / product launch hitting target"
- [LESSON] — the genuine insight behind the win — not "work hard"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 200-300 word LinkedIn achievement post that leads with the win but pivots quickly to audience value. Reads as reflective and generous, not self-promotional.

---

### SM-09: LinkedIn Post — Contrarian Take

**CONTEXT:**
Use to generate engagement by challenging a common belief in your industry. Contrarian posts earn more comments and shares than consensus posts — because people either agree enthusiastically or want to debate.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn contrarian copywriter. Write a post challenging [COMMON BELIEF — e.g., "the idea that AI writing tools are replacing copywriters"]. Structure: (1) state the belief you're challenging directly, (2) your contrarian position in one sentence, (3) 3 supporting arguments, each in 2-3 sentences, (4) nuance — acknowledge what's true in the mainstream view, (5) closing position. Total: 300-400 words. Confident but not aggressive tone.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [COMMON BELIEF] — e.g., "more content = better reach" or "you need to post every day to grow on LinkedIn"
- [YOUR CONTRARIAN POSITION] — must be genuinely defensible, not just attention-seeking

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 300-400 word LinkedIn contrarian post with a clear position, 3 supporting arguments, and acknowledgment of nuance. Generates comments from both agreement and disagreement.

---

### SM-10: Twitter/X Thread — Educational (10 tweets)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for Twitter/X threads that teach a framework, share research, or break down a complex topic. Threads are the highest-reach format on X and generate follows, retweets, and bookmarks when they deliver genuine value.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Twitter/X thread writer. Write a 10-tweet thread on [TOPIC — e.g., "why most AI-generated marketing copy fails (and the fix)"]. Tweet 1 (hook): promise + tease that makes people want to read the whole thread. Tweets 2-9: one insight, example, or step per tweet — each under 280 characters and able to stand alone. Tweet 10: summary + CTA (follow for more / link to product). Label each tweet by number. No filler tweets.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TOPIC] — a specific, teachable topic with 8-9 distinct points
- [CTA] — follow, link to product, or invite replies

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 10-tweet thread with labeled tweets, each under 280 characters. Hook tweet is strong enough to stop the scroll. Each middle tweet delivers a single standalone insight. Final tweet drives action.

---

### SM-11: Twitter/X Thread — Story Thread

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a narrative thread that tells a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Story threads earn the highest engagement on X because they create suspense — readers follow to find out what happens.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Twitter/X story thread writer. Write a 10-tweet story thread about [STORY — e.g., "how I built a digital product business in 90 days from scratch"]. Tweet 1: hook — the ending or a peak-tension moment that makes readers want to know how. Tweets 2-8: the chronological story — one development per tweet. Tweet 9: the lesson or turning point. Tweet 10: what it means for the reader + CTA. Each tweet under 280 characters.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [STORY] — a genuine personal or business narrative with a beginning, challenge, and resolution
- [TENSION HOOK] — the most compelling moment of the story — put this first

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 10-tweet story thread with a non-chronological hook, sequential story development, a lesson tweet, and a CTA final tweet. Each tweet under 280 characters and readable standalone.

---

### SM-12: Twitter/X Single Tweet — Viral Hook

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a single high-impact tweet designed to generate retweets and engagement. Single viral tweets work best when they compress a complex truth into one unforgettable sentence.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a tweet copywriter. Write 5 tweet variants for [THEME — e.g., "the value of structured AI prompts for marketers"]. Types: (1) contrarian take, (2) specific number/statistic, (3) "hot take" format, (4) two-line poem or parallel structure, (5) question format. Each under 280 characters. No hashtags. No emoji unless it serves the tweet. Label each variant by type.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [THEME] — your core message or expertise area
- Pick the variant that feels most authentic to your voice

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
5 tweet variants (under 280 characters each) across 5 formats: contrarian, stat, hot take, parallel structure, question. Labeled by format. Each is distinct and independently shareable.

---

### SM-13: TikTok Script — Hook-Value-CTA (60 seconds)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for TikTok videos that educate or demonstrate. TikTok's algorithm rewards completion rate — videos that hold attention to the end. Structure is: hook that creates curiosity, fast-paced value delivery, payoff at the end.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a TikTok scriptwriter. Write a 60-second TikTok script for [TOPIC — e.g., "a live demo of generating a Facebook ad using an AI prompt"].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A timestamped 60-second TikTok script with on-screen text notes, voiceover (~150 words), and a closing CTA. Completion-optimized — each section earns the next.

---

### SM-14: TikTok Script — "Point of View" Format

**CONTEXT:**
Use for TikTok POV videos where the creator speaks to the camera as if the viewer is in a specific situation. POV format creates immediate identification and is one of TikTok's most shareable formats.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a TikTok POV script writer. Write a TikTok script in the "POV: you're [SITUATION]" format for [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Situation: [POV SITUATION — e.g., "POV: you're a freelancer who just landed a new client and has 24 hours to write their whole onboarding sequence"].

---

### SM-15: Pinterest Description — Product Pin

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Pinterest SEO copywriter. Write a product pin description for [PRODUCT NAME]. Length: 100-500 characters (Pinterest ideal: 200-300).

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [KEYWORD 1/2/3] — e.g., "AI marketing prompts / ChatGPT for business / digital marketing templates"

---

### SM-16: Pinterest Description — Blog Post / Article Pin

**CONTEXT:**

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Pinterest content pin writer. Write a pin description for an article titled [ARTICLE TITLE — e.g., "How to Write Facebook Ads With AI: 5 Prompts That Actually Work"].

---

### SM-17: Facebook Page Post — Community Engagement

**CONTEXT:**
Use for organic Facebook Page posts designed to generate comments and engagement. Facebook's algorithm deprioritizes promotional posts — engagement-first content builds the page reach needed for ads to perform.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Facebook community post writer. Write an organic Facebook post for [BRAND PAGE NAME] that drives comments on [TOPIC — e.g., "how your audience uses AI for their marketing"]. Format: share a relatable observation or question, give your own take in 2-3 sentences, end with a specific, easy-to-answer question. Under 150 words.

- [QUESTION] — make it specific enough to answer in 1-3 sentences

---

---

### SM-19: Instagram Story Sequence — 5 Slides (Poll + Swipe Up)

**CONTEXT:**

---

### SM-20: LinkedIn Post — Employee/Founder Spotlight

Use to humanize a brand by spotlighting the person behind it. Founder and team spotlights on LinkedIn generate high engagement because people connect with people, not brands.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a LinkedIn brand humanization writer. Write a "meet the person behind [BRAND NAME]" LinkedIn post. Structure: (1) one surprising or specific personal detail that makes the founder/team member relatable, (2) their expertise and background in 2-3 sentences, (3) what drives them in this work, (4) an invitation to connect. Total: 200-300 words. First-person voice. Genuine — not a PR bio.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [PERSONAL DETAIL] — something genuine and unexpected that humanizes the person
- [EXPERTISE] — their relevant background without overselling it

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

---

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product launch tweet writer. Write 3 tweet variants announcing the launch of [PRODUCT NAME]. Variant 1: lead with the outcome/result. Variant 2: lead with the most surprising or unexpected feature. Variant 3: lead with the price or offer as the hook. Each tweet: under 280 characters. Include link placeholder [URL].

Structure: (1) name the trend clearly, (2) your take — what it really means (not surface analysis), (3) what smart marketers are doing differently as a result, (4) optional: how [PRODUCT NAME] addresses this specifically. Total: 250-350 words. Cite a specific example or data point if possible.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TREND] — a current development in your industry or market

---

### SM-24: Instagram Caption — Before/After Split

Use for before/after content posts that demonstrate a transformation. Before/after posts work best when the "before" is painfully familiar and the "after" is specifically aspirational.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a transformation content writer. Write an Instagram caption for a before/after post showing the transformation achievable with [PRODUCT NAME]. Before: [BEFORE STATE — e.g., "spending 3 hours writing captions that feel generic and get zero saves"]. After: [AFTER STATE — e.g., "30-minute content session, week of posts done, engagement up"]. Bridge: [PRODUCT NAME] is the difference. CTA: link in bio. Under 125 words. Include 3 hashtags.

---

### SM-25: TikTok Script — "Things I Wish I Knew" Format

**PROMPT:**
Act as a TikTok educational script writer. Write a "things I wish I knew before [TOPIC]" TikTok script for 60 seconds. Topic: [TOPIC — e.g., "starting to use AI for my marketing"]. List 5 things — each revealed quickly with brief context. Hook (0-3 sec): "5 things I wish someone told me about [TOPIC] before I wasted 3 months." Items (3-50 sec): rapid revelation format.

---

## Category 4: Landing Pages

Hero headlines, feature-to-benefit bullets, social proof blocks, FAQ sections, CTA copy, pricing page copy — this category builds complete landing page copy blocks. Each prompt produces a section ready to drop into a page.

---

### LP-01: Hero Headline + Subheadline (Above the Fold)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the most important copy on any landing page — the headline and subheadline above the fold. Visitors decide within 5 seconds whether to stay or leave based on this section alone.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a conversion copywriter specializing in landing pages. Write 5 hero headline + subheadline combinations for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Each headline: under 10 words, specific outcome or transformation, not a tagline. Each subheadline: 1-2 sentences expanding on who this is for and what they get.

- [CORE OUTCOME] — e.g., "write a month of marketing copy in one afternoon"

5 headline + subheadline pairs labeled by type (outcome/problem/proof). Each headline under 10 words, each subheadline 1-2 sentences. Ready to A/B test against each other.

---

### LP-02: Value Proposition Statement (One Sentence)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when you need to distill your entire product into one sentence — for the hero section, meta descriptions, or pitch context. A strong value proposition answers: what is it, who is it for, and what's the result.

### LP-03: Feature-to-Benefit Bullet Points (5 bullets)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the features section of a landing page. Features tell; benefits sell. This prompt converts a list of product features into benefit-first bullet points that answer "so what?" for each feature.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a benefit copywriter. Transform these 5 product features into benefit-first bullet points for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page: Feature 1: [FEATURE 1]. Feature 2: [FEATURE 2]. Feature 3: [FEATURE 3]. Feature 4: [FEATURE 4]. Feature 5: [FEATURE 5]. Format: "[Benefit] — [brief feature explanation]." Each bullet under 20 words. Lead with the buyer's gain, not the product's capability.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [FEATURE 1-5] — e.g., "500 prompts / 8 categories / instant download / works with any AI / one-time price"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
5 benefit-first bullet points with em-dash separator. Each bullet under 20 words, leading with the outcome or gain rather than the technical feature.

---

### LP-04: Social Proof Section — Testimonial Curation and Framing

**CONTEXT:**
Use to write the framing copy around a testimonial section. The testimonials themselves come from customers — this prompt writes the section header, subheader, and brief intro that makes the testimonials more persuasive.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a social proof section copywriter. Write the framing copy for a testimonial section on [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. Include: (1) section headline (under 10 words) that doesn't just say "what our customers say," (2) subheadline (1 sentence): reference a specific number of customers or outcome, (3) brief intro paragraph (2 sentences): frame who these buyers are and why their results are typical.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [NUMBER OF BUYERS] — e.g., "500+ buyers"
- [TYPICAL RESULT] — the most common or compelling outcome buyers share

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A testimonial section framing with headline (under 10 words), 1-sentence subheadline, and 2-sentence intro paragraph. Creates context that makes individual testimonials feel representative, not cherry-picked.

---

### LP-05: FAQ Section — 8 Questions and Answers

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the FAQ section of a sales page. FAQs convert fence-sitters by handling objections in a format that feels informational rather than sales-y. Each question should be a real objection or concern.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a sales FAQ copywriter. Write 8 FAQ entries for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. Questions should address: (1) pricing/value objection, (2) "will this work for me?" concern, (3) technical question (how to access/use), (4) guarantee/refund policy, (5) who this is NOT for, (6) comparison to free alternatives, (7) time investment required, (8) what happens after purchase. Each answer: 2-4 sentences, honest, direct. No waffling.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- Customize answers to your actual product terms, guarantee, and delivery method

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
8 FAQ pairs with specific, direct answers (2-4 sentences each). Covers pricing, fit, technical, guarantee, exclusion, comparison, time, and delivery. Honest enough that prospects trust the page.

---

### LP-06: CTA Button Copy — 10 Variants

**CONTEXT:**
Use to test different CTA button text. "Buy Now" and "Get Started" are the worst performing CTAs because they focus on what the buyer must do, not what they receive. This prompt generates 10 specific-outcome alternatives.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a CTA optimization specialist. Write 10 CTA button copy variants for [PRODUCT NAME]. Current CTA: "[CURRENT CTA — e.g., 'Buy Now']." Generate 10 alternatives: 3 action + outcome format ("Get [result]"), 3 first-person format ("Give me [result]"), 2 urgency format ("Get [result] today"), 2 specific format (include price or quantity). Each under 7 words. Label by format type.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

10 CTA button variants (under 7 words each) in 4 format types: action+outcome, first-person, urgency, specific. Labeled by format. All 10 are testable alternatives to your current CTA.

---

### LP-07: Pricing Section Copy — Two-Tier Comparison

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a pricing page or section featuring two product tiers. Pricing copy must make the value of each tier crystal clear and make the higher tier feel like the obvious choice for most buyers.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a pricing page copywriter. Write copy for a two-tier pricing section: [TIER 1 NAME] at [PRICE 1] and [TIER 2 NAME] at [PRICE 2]. For each tier: tier name + badge (e.g., "Most Popular"), price + price qualifier, 1-sentence description of who it's for, 4-5 feature bullets (benefit format), and CTA button text. The higher tier should feel like a no-brainer upgrade, not just "more stuff."

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TIER 1/2 NAME] — e.g., "Starter" and "Full Kit"
- [PRICE 1/2] — e.g., "$27" and "$47"
- [TIER FEATURES] — list the actual features in each tier accurately

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
Two-tier pricing section copy with tier names, prices, one-sentence descriptions, 4-5 feature bullets each, and CTAs. Higher tier includes "Most Popular" badge framing. Ready for a designer.

---

### LP-08: Above-the-Fold Section — Complete Copy Block

**CONTEXT:**
Use to write the complete above-the-fold section as a cohesive unit — headline, subheadline, proof bar, and primary CTA. Everything the visitor sees before scrolling must earn the scroll.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an above-the-fold section copywriter. Write the complete above-the-fold copy block for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page: (1) Headline (under 10 words — specific outcome). (2) Subheadline (1-2 sentences — who it's for, what they get). (3) Proof bar (3 short credibility signals: buyer count, rating, or notable result — each under 6 words). (4) Primary CTA (under 7 words). (5) Risk reducer text under the CTA (under 10 words — e.g., "30-day money-back guarantee").

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PROOF SIGNALS] — e.g., "500+ buyers / 4.9 stars / 30-day guarantee"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A complete above-the-fold copy block with 5 labeled elements. Each element is character-count compliant and works as a cohesive unit. Ready for Figma/Canva/design.

---

### LP-09: Problem Section — Agitate Pain (Bulleted)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the "problem" section of a PAS-structured landing page. This section must make the visitor feel deeply understood — it mirrors their experience back at them with enough specificity to feel personal.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a problem-section copywriter. Write the "problem agitation" section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. Include: (1) section headline (2-4 words: "Sound familiar?" or "Still doing this?"), (2) 5-7 pain point bullets — each describes a specific, relatable frustration in first or second person. Each bullet: under 15 words. End with a transition sentence into the solution. Target audience: [TARGET AUDIENCE].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., "solopreneurs writing their own marketing copy"
- [PAIN POINTS] — specific frustrations from customer interviews, reviews, or your own experience

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A problem section with section headline, 5-7 pain bullets (under 15 words each), and a transition sentence. Pain bullets are specific and relatable — visitors see themselves.

---

### LP-10: Solution Section — "Here's What Changes"

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the solution reveal section immediately after the problem agitation section. The transition from problem to solution should feel like a breath of fresh air — the contrast is the selling point.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a solution-section copywriter. Write the solution reveal section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. Structure: (1) section headline: contrast with the problem — e.g., "What if it didn't have to be that hard?" (2) 2-sentence explanation of what [PRODUCT NAME] is and how it works, (3) 3 outcome bullets: "Now you can [OUTCOME]" — each under 15 words, (4) brief product description: what's literally inside.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

- [3 OUTCOMES] — e.g., "write a week of content in 30 minutes / create ads in 5 minutes / never stare at a blank page again"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A solution section with contrast headline, 2-sentence product intro, 3 "now you can" outcome bullets, and a brief product description. Reads as relief after the problem section.

---

### LP-11: Product Description — What's Inside (Detailed)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the "what's inside" or "here's what you get" section of a digital product landing page. This section must be specific enough to justify the price — vague descriptions don't convert.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a product description copywriter. Write a detailed "what's inside" section for [PRODUCT NAME]. For each product component, write: component name + short label (e.g., "500+ Structured Prompts — for every marketing task"), 2-3 sentence description of what it includes and why each detail matters, and the specific outcome the buyer gets from this component. Product components: [COMPONENT 1], [COMPONENT 2], [COMPONENT 3]. Section headline and intro paragraph included.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Full Kit"
- [COMPONENT 1/2/3] — e.g., "500+ prompts / 8 categories / 4 Notion templates"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A "what's inside" section with headline, intro paragraph, and 2-3 component descriptions. Each component name + label + 2-3 sentence description + outcome. Specific enough to justify the price.

---

### LP-12: Trust Section — About the Creator

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the "who made this" section of a landing page. For faceless brands, this section can describe the origin story and problem solved without requiring personal disclosure. Trust is built through specificity, not celebrity.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a landing page trust section writer. Write the "who made this and why" section for [PRODUCT NAME]. This can be written in first person (with a name/brand) or third person (anonymous brand). Include: (1) the problem that motivated creating [PRODUCT NAME], (2) what was tried before building it, (3) what makes the creator qualified to build this, (4) a genuine belief or mission statement. Under 200 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PROBLEM MOTIVATION] — e.g., "spending $2K on freelancers and getting generic copy"
- [QUALIFICATION] — e.g., "tested 200+ prompt structures over 18 months"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 175-word trust section with origin story, qualification, and mission. Can be anonymous (brand voice) or personal (founder voice). Reads as genuine motivation, not a bio.

---

### LP-13: Guarantee Section — Risk Reversal Block

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the guarantee or risk-reversal section of a sales page. A strong guarantee is specific — not just "30-day money back" but explaining what that actually means and how it works.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a guarantee copywriter. Write a risk-reversal block for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. Include: (1) guarantee headline (under 10 words: "Your purchase is completely risk-free"), (2) specific guarantee terms: [GUARANTEE TERMS — e.g., "30 days, no questions asked, full refund"], (3) what specifically they can ask for a refund on (any reason? specific conditions?), (4) how to claim: [CLAIM PROCESS], (5) closing trust statement (1 sentence: what this guarantee reveals about your confidence in the product).

---

### LP-14: Closing CTA Section — Bottom of Page

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the final CTA section at the bottom of a long-form sales page. At this point, the visitor has read everything — this final section should be brief, confident, and close with a direct ask.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a closing section copywriter. Write the final CTA section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s sales page. The visitor has read the entire page — they don't need more information, they need a clear final push. Include: (1) closing headline (2-4 words — "Ready to start?" or "Your turn."), (2) 1-sentence recap of the offer (price + what's included), (3) final benefit statement (1 sentence — the transformation), (4) guarantee reminder (1 sentence), (5) CTA button text.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

- [TRANSFORMATION] — e.g., "start writing better marketing copy today"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 5-element closing CTA block: headline, offer recap, benefit, guarantee, CTA. Brief and decisive — assumes the visitor has read the full page. No new information introduced.

---

### LP-15: Scarcity / Urgency Section Copy

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your product has a genuine limited-time offer, launch price, or bonus expiry. Scarcity copy must be specific and truthful — "limited time offer" with no end date destroys trust.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a scarcity section copywriter. Write an urgency/scarcity section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. Scarcity mechanism: [MECHANISM — e.g., "launch price of $47 expires Sunday at midnight EST"]. Include: (1) urgency headline (state the deadline plainly), (2) what happens after the deadline (price increase, bonus removal, etc.), (3) brief encouragement to act now, (4) CTA with deadline reinforced. Under 100 words total. No manufactured fake scarcity.

---

### LP-16: Comparison Table — Your Product vs. Alternatives

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a feature comparison table on a landing page. Comparison tables convert high-intent buyers who are actively evaluating options. They work best when you include free/DIY alternatives, not just paid competitors.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a comparison table copywriter. Write a comparison table for [PRODUCT NAME] vs. 2 alternatives: (1) DIY (doing it yourself without any tool), (2) [ALTERNATIVE CATEGORY — e.g., "Monthly AI writing subscriptions"]. Comparison dimensions (rows): [DIMENSION 1 — e.g., "Monthly cost"], [DIMENSION 2 — e.g., "Setup time"], [DIMENSION 3 — e.g., "Works with any AI tool"], [DIMENSION 4 — e.g., "Time to first result"], [DIMENSION 5 — e.g., "What you own after purchase"]. Format as a markdown table.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [ALTERNATIVE CATEGORY] — describe the competitor category without naming brands
- [5 DIMENSIONS] — choose dimensions where your product wins clearly

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A markdown comparison table with 3 columns (Your Product / DIY / Alternative) and 5 rows. Each cell is a specific, factual claim. Rows chosen to favor your product honestly.

---

### LP-17: Trust Badges / Social Proof Bar Copy

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the trust badges or social proof bar that typically appears under the hero section or the CTA. Each badge is 3-6 words — they must be specific and credible, not vague ("Quality Guarantee" means nothing).

**PROMPT:**
Act as a trust badge copywriter. Write 6 trust badge labels for [PRODUCT NAME]. Each badge: 3-6 words maximum. Cover: (1) buyer count, (2) rating/satisfaction, (3) delivery method, (4) compatibility (works with X), (5) risk-reversal, (6) uniqueness/differentiation. Format: one label per line. All must be specific and verifiable — no vague claims.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- Replace with your real numbers: buyer count, rating, etc.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
6 trust badge labels (3-6 words each) covering 6 distinct credibility dimensions. All specific and based on real product facts. Ready for a designer to add icons.

---

### LP-18: Bonus Section — Adding Perceived Value

**CONTEXT:**
Use when adding bonuses to a product offer. Bonus section copy must make each bonus feel genuinely valuable (not filler) and explain why it's included with the main product.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a bonus section copywriter. Write copy for a [NUMBER]-bonus section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s sales page. For each bonus: bonus name + value statement (e.g., "Bonus 1: Email Swipe File — Value: $27, included free"), 2-sentence description of what it includes and why it's valuable, and why it's being given away with the main product. Section headline: "Everything you get when you order today." Total bonus value summary at the end.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [NUMBER] — e.g., 2 or 3 bonuses
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [BONUSES] — describe your actual bonuses with genuine value

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A bonus section with section headline, [N] bonus blocks (name/value/description/rationale), and total value summary. Bonuses feel earned and valuable — not padded.

---

### LP-19: Objection Handler — Inline Copy

**CONTEXT:**
Use to write inline objection handling copy — small pieces of reassurance copy placed adjacent to key conversion elements (next to the price, next to the CTA, etc.) that address silent hesitations.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an inline objection handler copywriter. Write 5 micro-copy objection handlers for [PRODUCT NAME]'s sales page. Each: 1-2 sentences, placed next to a specific page element. (1) Under the price: address "is it worth it?" (2) Under the CTA button: address "is this actually for me?" (3) Near the testimonials: address "are these real results?" (4) Near the guarantee: address "what does risk-free actually mean?" (5) In the FAQ: address "I've bought things like this before and didn't use them."

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- Customize each micro-copy answer to your actual product terms and customer experience

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
5 inline micro-copy objection handlers, each labeled by page placement. 1-2 sentences each. Honest and direct — dissolves hesitation without overselling.

---

### LP-20: "Who Is This For" Section

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a "who is this for" section that specifically identifies ideal buyers. This section converts by making the right people feel seen and, crucially, filters out bad-fit buyers who would refund anyway.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a targeting section copywriter. Write a "who is this for" section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. Format: two subsections. "This is for you if:" — 5 specific "you" statements identifying the ideal buyer. "This is NOT for you if:" — 3 honest statements about who shouldn't buy. Each statement: under 20 words. Honest over optimistic — wrong buyers cause chargebacks and bad reviews.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [FOR YOU IF] — describe your ideal customer's specific situation, not generic traits
- [NOT FOR YOU IF] — be genuinely honest about who this won't work for

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A targeting section with 5 "for you" and 3 "not for you" statements. Each under 20 words. Specificity over politeness — makes the right people say "this is exactly me."

---

### LP-21: Landing Page Meta Title and Description

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the SEO meta title and description for your landing page. These appear in Google results and affect both click-through rate and search ranking. The description should sell the click, not just describe the page.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an SEO landing page writer. Write 3 meta title variants (under 60 characters) and 3 meta description variants (under 160 characters) for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. Primary keyword: [KEYWORD]. Meta titles: one outcome-focused, one keyword-focused, one brand-focused. Meta descriptions: each must end with a CTA phrase and include the keyword naturally.

- [KEYWORD] — e.g., "AI marketing prompts" or "ChatGPT marketing templates"

---

### LP-22: Open Graph / Social Share Copy

**CONTEXT:**
Use for the Open Graph title and description that appears when your landing page is shared on social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter). OG copy is separate from meta copy and should be optimized for social click-through.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a social share copy specialist. Write Open Graph copy for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. OG title (under 60 characters): more emotional/benefit-driven than the meta title — this is for social, not Google. OG description (under 200 characters): expand on the title, include a social proof signal, end with an implicit or explicit CTA. Write 3 variants of each, labeled by approach.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [SOCIAL PROOF SIGNAL] — e.g., "500+ marketers / 4.9 stars / used by agency owners"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
3 OG title variants (under 60 chars) and 3 OG description variants (under 200 chars). Each pair is a cohesive unit. More conversational than SEO meta — optimized for social sharing.

---

### LP-23: Product Page — What You'll Be Able to Do (Outcome Framing)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for an "outcomes" or "results" section that frames the product in terms of what the buyer will be able to accomplish after using it. Outcome framing is more powerful than feature listing for digital products.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an outcome-framing copywriter. Write an "after [PRODUCT NAME], you'll be able to:" section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. List 6 specific capabilities the buyer gains — framed as "you'll be able to [do specific thing]." Each capability: under 20 words, specific and achievable, not vague aspiration. Section headline included.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [6 CAPABILITIES] — specific actions the buyer can take after using the product
- Make each capability distinct — no overlapping themes

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
An outcome section with headline and 6 "you'll be able to" bullets, each under 20 words. Specific enough that prospects can imagine doing each thing. Distinct across all 6 bullets.

---

### LP-24: Testimonial Write-Up (From Raw Feedback)

**CONTEXT:**
Use to transform raw customer feedback into polished testimonial copy. Real customer language is more compelling than edited copy, but raw feedback often needs structure and quotation marks to work on a landing page.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a testimonial editor. Transform this raw customer feedback into 3 polished testimonial formats: Raw feedback: "[RAW FEEDBACK — e.g., 'honestly love this thing, used it yesterday to write an ad and it worked way better than what I usually write, took like 20 minutes']." Format 1: short quote under 25 words. Format 2: medium quote 25-50 words with context. Format 3: star rating + headline + 2-sentence quote. Preserve the customer's authentic voice — don't professionalize it out of existence.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [RAW FEEDBACK] — paste actual raw customer quote or message
- Preserve their actual words — don't replace casual language with marketing language

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
3 testimonial format variations from one piece of raw feedback. Short / medium / star-rating-plus-quote. Each preserves the customer's voice. Ready to display on landing page.

---

### LP-25: Sales Video Script (VSL) — Full Structure

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a Video Sales Letter (VSL) on a landing page. VSLs typically replace the traditional long-form sales page copy or supplement it. A 5-10 minute VSL follows a specific structure that mirrors the written sales page.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a VSL scriptwriter. Write a 7-minute VSL outline and script for [PRODUCT NAME]. Structure: Hook (0-30 sec): problem statement that makes the viewer lean in. Agitation (0:30-2:00): develop the problem with 3 specific pain scenarios. Solution intro (2:00-3:00): introduce [PRODUCT NAME] and the mechanism. Proof (3:00-4:30): 3 buyer results, product demonstration summary. Offer (4:30-5:30): what's included, price, bonuses. Guarantee (5:30-6:00). CTA (6:00-7:00). Approximate word count per section included.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [3 PAIN SCENARIOS] — specific, relatable situations your buyer recognizes
- [3 BUYER RESULTS] — real or representative customer outcomes

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 7-section VSL outline with scripted copy for each section, section timestamps, and approximate word counts. Roughly 900-1,050 spoken words total (7 minutes at ~150 words/minute).

---

## Category 5: SEO

Meta titles, meta descriptions, blog post outlines, pillar content structures, internal linking anchor text, product page descriptions, FAQ schema content — this category covers all SEO copy needs from technical to content.

---

### SEO-01: Meta Title — 10 Variants for a Landing Page

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
10 meta title variants (under 60 characters each) labeled by type (keyword-first/benefit-first/brand/question). Character counts noted. Ready for A/B testing via search console.

---

### SEO-02: Meta Description — 5 Variants for a Landing Page

**CONTEXT:**
Use when writing or testing meta descriptions. While meta descriptions don't directly affect ranking, they dramatically affect click-through rate. The best meta descriptions are mini-ads, not summaries.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a meta description optimization specialist. Write 5 meta description variants (under 160 characters each) for [PAGE NAME]. Primary keyword: [KEYWORD]. Each must: contain the keyword naturally, end with a CTA or action phrase, and communicate specific value (not vague "learn more").

---

### SEO-03: Blog Post Outline — Keyword-Targeted Long-Form

**PROMPT:**

Include: H1 title (keyword included), meta description (under 160 chars), intro paragraph purpose, 4-6 H2 sections with purpose and 2-3 H3 subsections each, FAQ section (3 questions), and closing CTA. Total outline: 500-700 words. Note search intent for this keyword and how the outline addresses it.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [KEYWORD] — the specific target keyword from your research
- [SEARCH INTENT] — informational, commercial, transactional — note which this keyword is

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A complete blog post outline with H1, meta description, structured H2/H3 hierarchy, FAQ, and CTA. Includes search intent note. This is the planning document — not the post itself.

---

### SEO-04: Blog Post — Full Introduction Section

**CONTEXT:**
Use when writing the introduction to an SEO blog post. The intro must hook the reader, establish relevance, and include the target keyword in the first 100 words — without being obviously keyword-stuffed.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an SEO blog writer. Write a 200-word introduction for a blog post targeting "[KEYWORD — e.g., 'how to use AI for marketing']." Structure: (1) hook — open with a question, statistic, or surprising statement, (2) establish the problem or topic clearly, (3) preview what the post covers (1-2 sentences), (4) include [KEYWORD] naturally in the first 100 words. Tone: [TONE — e.g., "practical and direct, not academic"]. Do not use "In this article/post, I will..."

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [COMPETITOR CATEGORY] — describe the competitor type without naming specific brands

---

### SEO-16: Blog Post — "Best Of" Roundup (7 items)

### SEO-19: Title Tag and Meta Description — Blog Post

Organize into 5 clusters of 6: (1) how-to intent, (2) best/comparison intent, (3) specific platform/tool intent, (4) audience-specific intent, (5) problem/solution intent. For each keyword: the keyword phrase + estimated intent (informational / commercial / transactional). Present as a labeled table.

---

### BS-01: Brand Positioning Statement

**CONTEXT:**

Include: (1) voice description: 4 adjectives that characterize the brand voice, each with a 2-sentence explanation, (2) voice dial: for each adjective, describe where the brand sits on a spectrum (e.g., "Professional — but not corporate," "Confident — but not arrogant"), (3) do/don't examples: 5 pairs of on-brand vs. off-brand phrases, (4) platform variations: how voice shifts slightly for email vs. social vs. ad copy.

All three must be consistent in facts but calibrated in length.

For each differentiation dimension, rate your brand and the competitor category on a 1-5 scale, then write a 1-sentence articulation of your advantage.

A 9-dimension differentiation map with 1-5 ratings for your brand and competitor category, plus a 1-sentence advantage statement per dimension. Identifies your strongest differentiators.

---

### BS-08: Brand Promise Statement

**CONTEXT:**
Use to define the explicit promise your brand makes to customers. A brand promise is the commitment that every product, interaction, and communication must fulfill — it's the standard you're held to.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a brand strategist. Write a brand promise statement for [BRAND NAME] that: (1) is specific enough to be testable ("we will [X]"), (2) is relevant enough to motivate purchase, (3) is authentic enough to actually deliver on. Format: (1) the 1-sentence promise, (2) what it means operationally (what you must do to fulfill it), (3) what failure looks like (what would break this promise), (4) how it shows up in the product. Under 200 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- Base the promise on what you can actually deliver — not aspirational claims

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A brand promise (1 sentence) plus 3 supporting definitions: operational meaning, failure conditions, product manifestation. Under 200 words. Specific enough to audit against.

---

### BS-09: Messaging Pillars — 3-Pillar Framework

**CONTEXT:**
Use to define the 3 core themes that all brand messaging returns to. Messaging pillars are the 3 things you always say, no matter the channel, audience, or format — they create the consistency of a recognizable brand.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a messaging framework strategist. Define 3 messaging pillars for [BRAND NAME]. For each pillar: (1) pillar name (2-4 words), (2) core claim (1 sentence — what this pillar asserts), (3) supporting proof points (3 facts, features, or results that back the claim), (4) how it shows up in copy (example headline, email subject, and social post each embodying this pillar). Format: 3 parallel blocks.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- Pillars should be distinct — no two pillars should overlap in meaning

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
3 messaging pillar blocks, each with name, claim, 3 proof points, and 3 copy examples (headline/email subject/social post). Shows how the same pillar theme manifests across different formats.

---

### BS-10: Brand Name Evaluation Framework

**CONTEXT:**
Use when evaluating a brand name shortlist. Naming decisions are high-stakes and irreversible — this framework applies consistent criteria across candidates so the decision isn't made on gut feel alone.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a brand naming strategist. Evaluate these brand name candidates for [PRODUCT/BRAND TYPE — e.g., "an AI marketing prompt kit"]: [NAME 1], [NAME 2], [NAME 3]. Evaluate each on: (1) memorability (1-5), (2) pronunciation clarity (1-5), (3) domain availability likelihood (high/med/low), (4) trademark risk assessment (high/med/low), (5) category fit (does it communicate what the product is?), (6) international concerns (offensive/confusing in other languages?). Total score + recommendation.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [NAME 1/2/3] — your actual name candidates
- [PRODUCT/BRAND TYPE] — what this brand is
- Verify domain and trademark availability yourself — this is a framework, not legal advice

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A scored evaluation table for 3 name candidates across 6 criteria, with a total score and a recommendation with rationale. Use alongside domain + trademark checks.

---

### BS-11: Customer Journey Map — 5 Stages

**CONTEXT:**
Use to map the full customer journey from awareness through advocacy. A customer journey map shows what the customer is thinking and feeling at each stage, which informs messaging strategy at every touchpoint.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a customer experience strategist. Write a customer journey map for a buyer of [PRODUCT NAME]. Map 5 stages: (1) Unaware, (2) Problem Aware, (3) Solution Aware, (4) Product Aware, (5) Post-Purchase. For each stage: (a) what the customer is thinking, (b) what they feel, (c) what marketing touchpoint reaches them here, (d) what message they need to move to the next stage. Format as a table with 4 columns across 5 rows.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- Base the thinking/feeling columns on real customer insights, not assumptions

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 5-stage customer journey map table (5 rows x 4 columns: stage / thinking / feeling / touchpoint / message). Shows what to say, where, and why at each stage. Drives content and channel strategy.

---

### BS-12: Brand Architecture — Product Naming System

**CONTEXT:**
Use when you have or are planning multiple products. A naming architecture system ensures products feel related without being confusingly similar, and positions each tier or product clearly in the buyer's mind.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a brand architecture strategist. Design a product naming system for [BRAND NAME] with [NUMBER] products or tiers: [PRODUCT LIST]. For each, provide: (1) recommended product name (descriptive, memorable, fits architecture), (2) naming rationale (why this name vs. alternatives), (3) how it positions within the portfolio (entry/mid/premium), (4) the naming pattern (so future products fit the same system). Overall: does the naming system feel coherent as a family?

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [NUMBER/PRODUCT LIST] — e.g., "2 products: Starter kit ($27) and Full Kit ($47)"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A naming system document for [N] products with name, rationale, portfolio positioning, and pattern description per product. Includes an overall coherence assessment.

---

### BS-13: Competitor Analysis — 4-Competitor Brief

**CONTEXT:**
Use to conduct a structured competitor analysis before building or refreshing brand messaging. Understanding the competitive landscape prevents positioning overlap — you can't differentiate without knowing what you're differentiating from.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a competitive intelligence analyst. Write a brief competitor analysis for [BRAND NAME] in the [MARKET — e.g., "AI marketing tools"] space. Analyze 4 competitors: [COMPETITOR 1 TYPE], [COMPETITOR 2 TYPE], [COMPETITOR 3 TYPE], [COMPETITOR 4 TYPE]. For each: (1) primary positioning (how they describe themselves), (2) target customer, (3) key differentiators they claim, (4) apparent weaknesses, (5) what they own in the mind of buyers (their category position). Conclude: the positioning gap [BRAND NAME] should occupy.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [COMPETITOR TYPES] — describe competitor categories without naming specific brands
- Base analysis on publicly available information: websites, ads, reviews

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 4-competitor brief with 5 fields per competitor and a positioning gap conclusion. Shows specifically where the market is crowded and where there's space to position uniquely.

---

### BS-14: Category Design Brief

**CONTEXT:**
Use when you want to create or define your own category rather than competing in an existing one. Category design is the most powerful brand strategy — owning a category makes you the default leader within it.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a category design strategist. Write a category design brief for [BRAND NAME]. Include: (1) the existing category you'd be competing in if you don't create your own, (2) what's wrong with that category from the buyer's perspective, (3) the new category you're creating — give it a name and define it in 1-2 sentences, (4) the "before/after" of the old category vs. your new one, (5) who the buyers are in this new category, (6) the enemy (what you're against, not who). Under 400 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- Think: "Instead of being 'another AI writing tool,' what new category could we define?"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 400-word category design brief with old category, category problem, new category name and definition, before/after contrast, buyer description, and "enemy." Strategic foundation for category-first positioning.

---

### BS-15: Brand Tagline — 10 Candidates

**CONTEXT:**
Use when developing or testing brand taglines. Taglines are the compressed expression of your brand's positioning — they're heard thousands of times, so they must be simple, specific, and memorable.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a brand tagline strategist. Write 10 tagline candidates for [BRAND NAME]. Requirements for each: (1) under 7 words, (2) specific enough to be meaningful, (3) not a generic category claim ("the best X" rejects), (4) memorable on first hearing. Generate 2 each of: outcome-focused, process-focused, promise-focused, identity-focused, and contrast-focused taglines. Label each by type and rate memorability (1-5).

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [CORE POSITIONING] — what the brand fundamentally does or stands for
- Test shortlisted taglines with your target audience before committing

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
10 tagline candidates labeled by type (outcome/process/promise/identity/contrast) with memorability ratings (1-5). All under 7 words. Specific, not generic. Use for audience testing.

---

### BS-16: Brand Mission and Vision Statements

**CONTEXT:**
Use to define mission (what you do and why today) and vision (where you're going). These are internal north stars and external trust signals — they're often on About pages, decks, and job postings.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a purpose-driven brand strategist. Write mission and vision statements for [BRAND NAME]. Mission: what [BRAND NAME] does, for whom, and why it matters — present tense, specific, achievable today. Vision: the world you're working toward if [BRAND NAME] succeeds at scale — ambitious but grounded, not marketing hyperbole. Also write: 3 core values with 1-sentence explanations each. Format: mission / vision / values as three labeled sections.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- Mission: specific enough to audit against — can you do this today?
- Vision: ambitious enough to inspire but not so abstract it's meaningless

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
Three sections: mission statement (1-2 sentences), vision statement (1-2 sentences), 3 core values with 1-sentence explanations. All grounded in what the brand actually does and believes.

---

### BS-17: Brand Voice Persona — Character Profile

**CONTEXT:**
Use to define your brand voice as a character — an exercise that makes voice guidelines concrete and memorable. When brand voice is defined as "who would say this," it's easier to write consistently.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a brand character designer. Define [BRAND NAME]'s brand voice as a specific character. Answer: (1) If [BRAND NAME] were a person, what would their job title be? (2) What's their communication style in a conversation? (3) What would they never say? (4) What are they passionate about? (5) How do they respond to customer frustration? (6) What books/podcasts do they reference? (7) Celebrity or fictional character closest to the voice. Use this to create a 200-word character profile.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- Character should reflect the brand you want to project — not the founder's personal voice

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 200-word brand voice character profile with 7 defining attributes. Used as a reference when writing any brand copy — ask "would this character say this?"

---

### BS-18: Customer Persona — Detailed Profile (3 Personas)

**CONTEXT:**
Use when defining multiple buyer personas for a product with a broad audience. Personas help copywriters, ad buyers, and product teams speak to specific people rather than an imaginary average.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a persona development strategist. Write 3 distinct buyer personas for [PRODUCT NAME]. For each persona: name + role (fictional but specific), current situation (what they're doing professionally), core frustration with their current approach, what they've tried before, goal with [PRODUCT NAME], purchase trigger (what makes them buy today), preferred communication channel, and a direct quote that captures their mindset. Personas: [PERSONA 1 TYPE], [PERSONA 2 TYPE], [PERSONA 3 TYPE].

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PERSONA 1/2/3] — e.g., "freelance marketer / agency owner / solopreneur building their own brand"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
3 persona profiles, each with 8 fields (role, situation, frustration, tried, goal, trigger, channel, quote). Distinct enough that copy targeting one persona is clearly different from copy targeting another.

---

### BS-19: Unique Selling Proposition (USP) Development

**CONTEXT:**
Use to develop and sharpen the Unique Selling Proposition — the one reason buyers should choose you over all alternatives. A true USP is verifiable, specific, and important to the buyer.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a USP strategist. Develop the Unique Selling Proposition for [PRODUCT NAME]. Process: (1) list 8 potential differentiators (features, outcomes, model, price, experience), (2) score each on: is it important to buyers (1-5)? Is it unique to us (1-5)? Is it defensible (1-5)? (3) Highest total score = primary USP. (4) Write the USP in 3 formats: 10-word headline, 25-word statement, 50-word elevator pitch. Show the scoring.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- Be honest in the scoring — inflated uniqueness scores lead to weak positioning

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A USP development worksheet: 8 differentiators with 3-criteria scores, a primary USP identified by highest score, and 3 USP format expressions (10/25/50 words). Shows the reasoning behind the final USP.

---

### BS-20: Brand Values — Articulation and Expression

**CONTEXT:**
Use to define brand values that are specific and operational — not generic words like "integrity" that every brand claims and none can measure. This prompt produces values that guide actual decisions.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a brand values strategist. Define 5 core values for [BRAND NAME]. For each value: (1) value name (2-4 words), (2) what it means operationally — what behavior does it require?, (3) what it would mean to violate this value — a specific example, (4) how it shows up in the product and in customer communication. Values should be specific enough to create tension with other choices.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- Avoid: innovation, integrity, excellence, quality — choose values specific to your brand

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
5 brand values with 4-part definitions (name/operational meaning/violation example/expression). Specific enough to guide real product and communication decisions.

---

### BS-21: Content Strategy Framework — Brand Voice to Content Types

**CONTEXT:**
Use to translate brand positioning and voice into a content strategy. This framework ensures all content types serve both audience needs and brand goals simultaneously.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a content strategy architect. Build a content strategy framework for [BRAND NAME]. Include: (1) content mission statement (1 sentence: who you create content for, what you want them to do with it), (2) 4 content pillars (themes that all content maps to), (3) content types per pillar (3 formats per pillar), (4) content-to-business goal mapping (which content type serves: awareness / consideration / conversion / retention). Format as a structured framework.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [4 PILLARS] — themes central to your brand and audience's interests
- Each content type should serve a specific business goal — not just fill a calendar

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A content strategy framework with mission statement, 4 pillars, 3 formats per pillar, and content-to-goal mapping. Serves as the strategic foundation for a content calendar.

---

### BS-22: Brand Audit — Self-Evaluation Checklist

**CONTEXT:**
Use to conduct a periodic brand audit evaluating consistency, clarity, and impact across all brand touchpoints. Brand audits identify gaps between intended positioning and actual customer perception.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a brand audit specialist. Create a 20-point brand audit checklist for [BRAND NAME]. Cover 5 sections of 4 points each: (1) Clarity (can someone new understand what [BRAND NAME] does in 5 seconds?), (2) Consistency (is messaging consistent across website, ads, email, social?), (3) Differentiation (does positioning clearly separate from competitors?), (4) Relevance (is the brand speaking to current buyer needs?), (5) Experience (does the buying/onboarding experience match the brand promise?). Each point: audit question + pass criteria.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- Conduct this audit annually or after major product/messaging changes

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 20-point brand audit checklist in 5 sections. Each point has an audit question and pass criteria. Run this across your actual brand assets: website, ads, emails, social, product.

---

### BS-23: Brand Repositioning Strategy — When to Pivot

**CONTEXT:**
Use when your current brand positioning isn't converting or when the market has changed. Repositioning is high-risk — this framework identifies when it's necessary and how to do it without confusing existing customers.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a brand strategy consultant. Write a repositioning strategy brief for [BRAND NAME]. Current positioning: [CURRENT POSITIONING]. Reason for considering reposition: [REASON — e.g., "not resonating with target audience / market has shifted / product has evolved beyond original positioning"]. Proposed new positioning: [NEW DIRECTION]. Include: (1) repositioning risk assessment, (2) what must stay the same (brand equity to preserve), (3) what must change, (4) transition communication plan for existing customers. Under 400 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [CURRENT/NEW POSITIONING] — be specific about both
- [REASON] — the specific market or business trigger for the reposition

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 400-word repositioning brief with risk assessment, equity-to-preserve list, change requirements, and transition communication plan. Structured decision framework — not just a new tagline.

---

### BS-24: Brand Story — Founder Background Version

**CONTEXT:**
Use when the founder's personal background is a key part of the brand's credibility and differentiation. Founder-led brand stories must be specific and genuine — they build trust by showing the human behind the product.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a founder brand story writer. Write the founder story for [BRAND NAME] that positions [FOUNDER BACKGROUND — e.g., "10 years in marketing agencies"] as the source of the product's credibility. Structure: (1) where they started and what they were doing, (2) the specific problem they kept encountering (not vague), (3) the moment they decided to build a solution, (4) what they built and why it's different from what they'd tried, (5) who they built it for (and why those people matter to them). 300-word long version.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [BRAND NAME] — e.g., "ContentKit"
- [FOUNDER BACKGROUND] — the specific experience that qualifies the founder
- Be specific — avoid generic "I've always been passionate about X"

A 300-word founder story with 5-part structure (background / problem / decision / solution / audience). Reads as a genuine personal account that builds credibility through specificity.

---

### BS-25: Emotional Brand Positioning — The Feeling You Sell

**CONTEXT:**
Use to articulate the emotional core of your brand. Every successful brand sells a feeling, not just a product. Naming that feeling precisely allows you to create emotionally resonant copy, design, and experience.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an emotional positioning strategist. Identify and articulate the core emotional promise of [BRAND NAME]. Process: (1) list the 5 emotions your ideal customer feels after using [PRODUCT NAME] successfully, (2) the single most important emotion from that list — your "primary emotion," (3) the emotion they feel before buying (the negative state you're relieving), (4) the emotional transformation arc: from [NEGATIVE EMOTION] to [POSITIVE EMOTION], (5) how this emotional positioning shows up in tone, visuals, and copy. Under 250 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

---

## Category 7: Product Launch

Pre-launch waitlist copy, launch day email, Product Hunt post, press release, announcement social posts, post-launch follow-up, referral ask — this category covers the full product launch sequence from anticipation to post-launch momentum.

---

### PL-01: Pre-Launch Waitlist Landing Page

**CONTEXT:**
Use to build a pre-launch email list before your product goes live. Waitlist pages that reveal specifics (price, launch date, key features) convert better than vague "be the first to know" pages.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a pre-launch copywriter. Write a waitlist landing page for [PRODUCT NAME] launching on [DATE]. Include: (1) headline: what's coming and who it's for (under 12 words), (2) 3-sentence tease: enough specifics to create desire, not enough to satisfy it, (3) waitlist benefit: [EARLY BENEFIT — e.g., "early access + $10 off launch price"], (4) email form: label + button text + privacy line. Under 200 words. Create genuine anticipation without overpromising.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [DATE] — specific launch date
- [EARLY BENEFIT] — something genuinely valuable for signing up early

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 200-word waitlist page with headline, tease paragraph, benefit statement, and form copy. Creates real anticipation with specific details while keeping some mystery for launch day.

---

### PL-02: Launch Announcement Email to Waitlist

**CONTEXT:**
Use on launch day to notify waitlist subscribers. These are your warmest leads — they signed up specifically for this. The email must make them feel like insiders getting something before everyone else.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a launch day email writer. Write the launch announcement email to waitlist subscribers for [PRODUCT NAME]. Structure: (1) acknowledge their wait with genuine appreciation, (2) it's live — direct link, (3) their exclusive access window: [WINDOW — e.g., "24 hours before public launch"], (4) any waitlist exclusive: [EXCLUSIVE — e.g., "$10 off — code applied automatically"], (5) what's inside — 3 bullets, (6) CTA. Under 200 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

A 200-word launch email to waitlist with insider framing, exclusive benefit, 3 product bullets, and CTA. Warm and specific — rewards the patience of early subscribers.

---

### PL-03: Product Hunt Launch Post

**CONTEXT:**
Use for your Product Hunt launch day. Product Hunt requires a tagline, description, and first comment from the maker. Getting upvotes in the first 2-3 hours determines the final ranking.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Product Hunt launch copywriter. Write the launch package for [PRODUCT NAME]: (1) Tagline (under 60 chars): what it does + for whom + result, (2) Description (under 260 chars): expand tagline with one specific detail, (3) First comment from maker (150-200 words): personal story of building it, who it's for, 3 things it does, what you'd love feedback on, genuine thanks.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PERSONAL STORY] — your actual motivation for building it
- [SPECIFIC DETAIL] — a specific feature or number in the description

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

---

### PL-04: Press Release — Product Launch

**CONTEXT:**
Use when distributing a press release for your product launch. Modern press releases earn backlinks from PR services and can generate journalist/blogger coverage when they have a real news hook.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a PR writer. Write a product launch press release for [PRODUCT NAME]. Include: headline (news-focused, under 12 words, keyword included), dateline, lead paragraph (who/what/when/where/why), supporting paragraph (key features and target audience), founder quote, about section (100 words), boilerplate, and contact info. Keyword: [KEYWORD]. Newsworthy angle: [NEWS HOOK — e.g., "new product offers alternatives to $50/month AI subscriptions at a $47 one-time price"]. 400-600 words, AP Style.

- [LAUNCH MESSAGE] — the one-sentence core announcement
- [URL] — your product page URL

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
5 platform-specific launch day posts. Each is native to its platform in length, tone, and format. Not the same text copy-pasted — genuinely adapted for each audience.

---

### PL-06: Launch Week Email Sequence (7 days)

**CONTEXT:**
Use for a 7-day launch window email sequence. Each email has one job — together they move subscribers from awareness through consideration to purchase, with escalating urgency as the launch window closes.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a launch email sequence writer. Write subject lines and 3-sentence summaries for a 7-day launch sequence for [PRODUCT NAME] at [LAUNCH PRICE]. Day 1: announcement + what's inside. Day 2: feature spotlight (show one specific prompt/feature in action). Day 3: buyer story/social proof. Day 4: objection handler. Day 5: bonus reveal or new angle. Day 6: deadline warning.

---

### PL-07: Webinar/Live Event Launch Copy

**CONTEXT:**
Use when launching a product via a live webinar or training. Webinar launches convert at higher rates than email-only launches because they create a live event experience with real-time social proof.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a webinar launch copywriter. Write the copy package for a live launch webinar for [PRODUCT NAME]. Include: (1) webinar registration page headline + subheadline (under 12 words each), (2) what attendees will learn (3 bullets), (3) webinar pitch: the offer reveal moment — what to say when you present the product (100-word script), (4) post-webinar email to non-buyers (150 words, sent within 1 hour).

---

### PL-08: Affiliate Launch Email — For Partners to Send

**CONTEXT:**
Use to write the email that affiliates send to their lists promoting your launch. Provide this pre-written email to affiliates — most affiliates won't promote without a template. The easier you make it, the more they send.

**PROMPT:**
Act as an affiliate launch email writer. Write a promotional email for affiliates to send to their lists promoting [PRODUCT NAME]. The affiliate's audience: [AFFILIATE AUDIENCE — e.g., "marketing professionals and business owners"].

Tone: peer recommendation, not sales blast.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [AFFILIATE AUDIENCE] — who affiliates' lists typically consist of
- [AFFILIATE LINK] — leave as [AFFILIATE LINK] placeholder

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A ready-to-send affiliate email with subject line and 200-word body. Affiliates fill in [AFFILIATE LINK] and send. Reads as a personal recommendation from the affiliate, not a vendor template.

---

### PL-09: Launch Countdown Social Posts (3-day countdown)

**CONTEXT:**
Use in the 3 days before launch to build anticipation on social media. Each countdown day reveals something new about the product, escalating excitement without giving away the final offer.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a launch countdown social media writer. Write a 3-day countdown post sequence for [PRODUCT NAME] on [PLATFORM — e.g., "Instagram"]. Day 3 (72 hours out): tease the category and audience — no price or full details. Day 2 (48 hours out): reveal one specific feature or benefit — build desire. Day 1 (24 hours out): preview the offer — price, what's included, when to buy. Each post under 150 words. Progressive reveal — don't front-load all information.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PLATFORM] — customize format for your primary platform
- Plan reveals in advance — what does each day reveal?

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
3 countdown posts (under 150 words each) with escalating reveals. Day 3 teases, Day 2 builds desire, Day 1 previews the offer. Reads as genuine anticipation-building, not a scheduling template.

---

### PL-10: Behind-the-Scenes Launch Content

Act as a behind-the-scenes launch content writer. Write a 300-word behind-the-scenes post about [PRODUCT NAME]'s creation. Reveal: (1) one specific challenge you solved in building it, (2) a decision you almost made differently (and why you're glad you didn't), (3) one surprising insight from the creation process. This post is for [PLATFORM — e.g., "LinkedIn" or "a launch email"]. Tone: reflective and genuine — shows the human behind the product.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PLATFORM] — adjust length and format for the destination
- Be specific — "I almost organized it by platform instead of by task" is better than "it was challenging"

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 300-word behind-the-scenes post with 3 genuine reveals from the creation process. Builds trust and anticipation without giving away the final product details.

---

### PL-11: Launch Event Invite — Free Training

**CONTEXT:**
Use to invite your list or audience to a free training that leads into a product launch. Free training invites convert better than direct sales invitations because they feel like an opportunity rather than a pitch.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a live training invite writer. Write an email inviting subscribers to a free training titled [TRAINING TITLE — e.g., "Live: How to Use AI to Write Your Marketing Copy in 30 Minutes"]. Structure: (1) what they'll be able to do after (specific), (2) what the training covers (3 bullets), (3) why it's live (not recorded), (4) logistics (date, time, registration link), (5) what's NOT going to happen (no fluff, no 2-hour pitch). Under 250 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [TRAINING TITLE] — your actual training title — must be specific
- [DATE/TIME] — exact date, time, and timezone
- [REGISTRATION LINK] — your actual Zoom or webinar link

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 250-word training invite email with outcome promise, 3 content bullets, live-event rationale, logistics, and a "what you won't get" section that builds trust. Drives RSVPs through genuine value promise.

---

### PL-12: Post-Launch Email to Non-Buyers

**CONTEXT:**
Use after the initial launch window closes to follow up with subscribers who didn't purchase. This email acknowledges the launch window closed and introduces a permanent option or next steps.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a post-launch follow-up email writer. Write an email to [PRODUCT NAME]'s launch list subscribers who didn't purchase during launch week. Acknowledge: the launch window closed. Inform: what changed (e.g., "price is now $67 permanently" or "launch bonuses have been removed"). Invite: they can still buy at the new terms. Include: 1 final reason they should consider it. Under 200 words. Tone: informational and non-pushy — this is news, not a final pitch.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [WHAT CHANGED] — price increase, bonus removal, or other terms that changed after launch
- [FINAL REASON] — one compelling reason to still consider it

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 175-word post-launch informational email that communicates what changed and offers a final purchase path. Not a high-pressure close — an honest update that some non-buyers convert from.

---

### PL-13: Launch Metrics Dashboard Brief

**CONTEXT:**
Use to plan the metrics you'll track during a product launch. Knowing what to measure before launch prevents scrambling for data during launch week and enables real-time optimization.

Include metrics to track for: (1) email (open rate, CTR, conversions per email), (2) ads (CPM, CTR, CPA, ROAS), (3) landing page (traffic, conversion rate, bounce rate, time on page), (4) revenue (total revenue, AOV, refund rate), (5) launch sequence performance (which email or day drove most revenue).

A launch metrics dashboard brief with 5 category sections, each containing 3-5 metrics with targets, measurement methods, and below-benchmark actions. Set this up before launch week begins.

---

### PL-14: Product Hunt Community Prep — First 100 Upvotes Strategy

**CONTEXT:**
Use to plan the strategy for driving the first 100 upvotes on Product Hunt. The first 2-3 hours determine if you'll trend — you need a coordinated rollout plan for your existing network.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a Product Hunt launch strategist. Write a pre-launch mobilization plan for [PRODUCT NAME] on Product Hunt. Include: (1) who to contact before launch and what to ask of them, (2) the exact ask message (30 words): specific, non-spammy, personal, (3) timing plan (launch at 12:01am PST — why?), (4) where to share the PH link on launch day (which communities, channels, lists), (5) what to do if you're not trending by 9am PST. Under 350 words.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

---

- [WHAT YOU'RE ASKING] — specific feedback format or commitment required

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 225-word beta invitation email with personalized framing, access description, ask, timeline, and claim CTA. Reads as a genuine insider invitation, not a free trial offer.

---

### PL-16: Launch Bonus Stack — Copy and Rationale

**CONTEXT:**
Use to write copy for a bonus stack that increases the perceived value of a product launch offer. Bonuses must feel genuinely valuable and directly related to the main product — not random add-ons.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a bonus copy writer. Write copy for a [NUMBER]-bonus stack for [PRODUCT NAME]'s launch offer. For each bonus: (1) name + retail value (e.g., "Bonus 1: Email Swipe File — Retail: $27, Yours Free"), (2) 2-sentence description (what it is + why it pairs perfectly with the main product), (3) why it's only available during launch. Total value summary. Section headline: "Everything you get when you order during launch week." Format: 1 block per bonus.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

---

### PL-17: Referral Launch Campaign — "Share and Earn"

**CONTEXT:**
Use to launch a referral campaign simultaneously with your product launch. Referral campaigns on launch day create compound growth — every buyer becomes a potential promoter.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a referral launch campaign copywriter. Write a referral campaign launch email for [PRODUCT NAME] buyers. Program: for every referral who purchases, the referrer gets [REWARD — e.g., "$10 credit toward a future purchase" or "30% commission via affiliate link"].

---

### PL-18: App Store Launch Description

**CONTEXT:**

- [LAUNCH OFFER] — the specific time-limited launch deal

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 250-350 word marketplace launch listing with outcome lead, feature bullets, audience description, launch offer, and guarantee. Keyword-included. Formatted for scanning not reading.

---

### PL-19: Launch Day DM Outreach — Personal Invite

**CONTEXT:**
Use to personally invite your most relevant connections to check out the launch. Direct message outreach on launch day from a real person converts significantly better than broadcast emails.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a personal launch outreach writer. Write a 3-message DM template for personally inviting [CONNECTION TYPE — e.g., "colleagues and professional network connections"] to check out [PRODUCT NAME]'s launch. Message 1: brief, personal, relevant — no hard pitch (under 50 words). Message 2: if they respond with interest — share the link + one specific reason it's relevant to them. Message 3: if no reply after 48 hours — brief follow-up (under 25 words). Label each message.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [CONNECTION TYPE] — who you're reaching out to personally
- Personalize Message 1 for each person — one detail makes it not feel like a template

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
3 DM templates (labeled Message 1/2/3) for personal launch outreach. Message 1 is under 50 words, casual, no pitch. Message 2 delivers the link with a personal hook. Message 3 is a brief, non-pushy follow-up.

---

### PL-20: Soft Launch vs. Hard Launch Decision Brief

**CONTEXT:**
Use when deciding between a soft launch (quiet rollout with no urgency) and a hard launch (coordinated campaign with a specific window). The right approach depends on your list size, product readiness, and goals.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a launch strategist. Write a decision brief for [PRODUCT NAME] comparing soft launch vs. hard launch. Soft launch: what it is, when it's the right choice, what it forfeits. Hard launch: what it is, when it's the right choice, what it requires. Evaluation criteria: list size, product maturity, available bandwidth, urgency goals. Recommendation for [PRODUCT NAME] based on [CONTEXT — e.g., "first product, small list of 200 subscribers"]. Under 300 words.

- [CONTEXT] — your specific situation: list size, product readiness, bandwidth

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A 300-word launch decision brief with soft vs. hard launch comparison, evaluation criteria, and a specific recommendation based on the provided context.

---

### PL-21: Launch Retrospective — Post-Mortem Template

**CONTEXT:**
Use after a product launch to document what worked, what didn't, and what to do differently. Launch retrospectives are often skipped — but the patterns discovered in retrospective significantly improve future launches.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a launch retrospective facilitator. Write a post-launch retrospective template for [PRODUCT NAME]. Sections: (1) Results summary (revenue, units sold, conversion rate, traffic, email list growth), (2) What worked (3 things — specific), (3) What didn't work (3 things — honest), (4) Surprises (what you didn't expect), (5) What to do differently next time, (6) Decisions to make before the next launch.

---

### PL-22: Launch Email — "Here's What You Missed" (Late Arrival)

**CONTEXT:**
Use to convert subscribers who missed the initial launch emails. "Here's what you missed" emails have high open rates because they acknowledge the reader wasn't engaged without shaming them.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a catch-up email copywriter. Write a "here's what you missed" email for subscribers who didn't open the [PRODUCT NAME] launch emails. Acknowledge they may have been busy. Brief them on what launched and what the offer is. If the launch window is still open: give them the link and deadline. If the window is closed: inform them of the current price and how to get it. Under 200 words. No guilt language.

---

### PL-23: Launch Testimonial Collection — Early Buyer Ask

**CONTEXT:**
Use 5-7 days after launch to collect testimonials from early buyers. Early buyer testimonials are launch gold — they're generated while enthusiasm is highest and can be used for ongoing promotion.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a testimonial collection email writer. Write an email to [PRODUCT NAME]'s first buyers (5-7 days after purchase) asking for feedback. Keep it short and specific — ask one question: "[SPECIFIC QUESTION — e.g., 'What's one marketing task you've already used the kit for?']." Explain that their answer helps future buyers. Optional incentive: [INCENTIVE]. Under 175 words. Subject line should not say "feedback" or "review request."

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**

A 150-word early-buyer testimonial email with a curiosity-gap subject line, single specific question, explanation of purpose, and optional incentive. Open rate increases when subject doesn't say "feedback."

---

### PL-24: Launch Day Celebration Post — Community Update

**CONTEXT:**
Use on launch day to announce to your community (newsletter, social, Slack group) that the product is live. Celebration posts invite community members to share and earn goodwill simultaneously.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a launch celebration post writer. Write a launch day community announcement for [BRAND NAME]'s launch of [PRODUCT NAME]. Platform: [PLATFORM — e.g., "Twitter/X thread"]. Structure: (1) announce it's live with a direct link, (2) share one specific thing that makes this product different, (3) share the launch story in 2-3 sentences (genuine), (4) invite community to share/upvote/tell someone, (5) thank the people who helped.

- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PLATFORM] — adjust format to platform

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
A platform-appropriate launch celebration post with announcement, differentiator, brief story, share invite, and thank you. Reads as genuine community celebration, not a launch blast.

---

### PL-25: Cold Email Launch Outreach — Potential Customers

**CONTEXT:**
Use to reach out to a manually curated list of highly relevant potential buyers on launch day. Cold email on launch day should be personal and targeted — not a blast list.

**PROMPT:**
Act as a launch cold email writer. Write a launch day cold email to a [TARGET COMPANY/PERSON TYPE — e.g., "freelance marketing consultant with their own client roster"]. Subject (under 50 chars): specific and relevant to their role. Body (under 150 words): (1) one-line on why you're reaching out to them specifically, (2) one-sentence product description relevant to their work, (3) what they'd use it for in their specific context, (4) launch offer and link. Small ask — not a meeting request.

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] — e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [TARGET COMPANY/PERSON TYPE] — be specific about who you're emailing
- Personalize the first sentence for each recipient — generic cold emails don't work

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

---

## Category 8: Video Scripts

YouTube hooks, tutorial scripts, channel trailers, VSLs, Reels/TikTok 30-second scripts, testimonial video prompts, and product demo scripts — this category covers every video format across all major platforms.

---

### VS-01: YouTube Video Hook — 5 Variants (First 30 Seconds)

**PROMPT:**
Act as a YouTube hook writer. Write 5 first-30-second hook scripts for a video about [TOPIC — e.g., "how to write Facebook ads using AI"].
