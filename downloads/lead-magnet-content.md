## Why Most Marketing Copy Fails

Most business owners write marketing copy the same way: they describe what their product does, list a few features, and end with "get in touch today." The result is copy that blends into every other business in the feed — vague, forgettable, and focused entirely on the seller rather than the buyer. Visitors skim it, feel nothing, and leave. Not because your product isn't good, but because the copy never made them feel like it was written for them.

The classic solution is to hire a professional copywriter. And it works — a skilled direct-response copywriter can transform a flat product description into something that genuinely moves people to act. But that transformation comes at a cost. A sales page rewrite runs $3,000–$5,000 with a mid-tier copywriter. An email sequence with five emails? Another $1,500–$3,000. A full launch package with ad copy, landing page, and email sequence can easily reach $8,000–$12,000. For most small businesses and solo operators, that math doesn't work — especially when you need copy for every product, every channel, and every campaign.

Here's what most people don't know: AI can produce 80% of a professional copywriter's output — but only if you give it the right structure. Generic prompts like "write me a Facebook ad for my product" produce generic copy. What makes the difference is a prompt engineered for a specific task, with a defined framework, a clear role for the AI, and precise variables to fill in. That's exactly what these 5 prompts do. They aren't generic. Each one is engineered to produce a specific output for a specific marketing task — with variables you fill in for your business.

## Prompt #1: Instagram Caption Hook Sequence

**Replaces:** $75/hr social media copywriter, 2-hour session to write 5 caption variations

---

### The Prompt

> Act as a social media copywriter who specializes in Instagram growth for product-based and service businesses. Generate 5 Instagram caption hook variations for the post below. Each hook must use a DIFFERENT hook type from this list: (1) Direct Question, (2) Bold Statement, (3) Story Opener, (4) Controversial Take, (5) "What If" Scenario. Each hook should be 1–2 sentences maximum and be immediately thumb-stopping. Do not write the full caption — just the opening hook for each variation.
>
> Product/Service: [PRODUCT OR SERVICE NAME]
> Target Audience: [TARGET AUDIENCE — e.g., "freelancers who struggle with getting paid on time"]
> Main Benefit: [THE SINGLE BIGGEST BENEFIT — e.g., "clients pay on average 3x faster"]
>
> Variables:
> - [PRODUCT OR SERVICE NAME]: e.g., "Clearline" (invoicing software for freelancers)
> - [TARGET AUDIENCE]: e.g., "freelancers who get paid late by clients"
> - [MAIN BENEFIT]: e.g., "automated payment reminders that collect without the awkward follow-up"

---

### Example Output

*For Clearline — invoicing software for freelancers*

**Hook 1 — Direct Question:**
Still chasing that invoice from three weeks ago? There's a better way to get paid.

**Hook 2 — Bold Statement:**
Most freelancers lose $2,400 a year just waiting for clients to pay them.

**Hook 3 — Story Opener:**
I used to spend every Friday morning sending the same follow-up email to the same three clients. Then I automated it.

**Hook 4 — Controversial Take:**
Chasing late payments isn't a client problem — it's a system problem. Here's why freelancers are responsible for fixing it.

**Hook 5 — "What If" Scenario:**
What if your invoices followed up with clients automatically, even while you're on vacation?

---

**What this replaces:** A social media copywriter would charge $75–$150 and take a full morning to produce 5 usable hook variations. You just did it in 3 minutes.

## Prompt #2: Email Subject Line Generator

**Replaces:** $100/hr email marketing strategist, 2–3 hours to develop a subject line swipe file for a campaign

---

### The Prompt

> Act as an email marketing strategist with 10 years of experience writing subject lines for high-converting promotional campaigns. Generate 10 email subject line variations for the promotional email described below. Use a DIFFERENT copywriting angle for each subject line, drawing from this list: (1) Curiosity Gap, (2) Urgency/Scarcity, (3) Social Proof, (4) Benefit-Led, (5) Personalization Hook, (6) Direct Question, (7) "How To", (8) Numbered List, (9) Fear of Missing Out, (10) Humor/Unexpected Angle. Label each with its angle. Keep all subject lines under 50 characters.
>
> Offer Description: [WHAT YOU ARE PROMOTING — e.g., "Black Friday sale: 40% off my online copywriting course"]
> Target Audience: [WHO IS ON YOUR LIST — e.g., "small business owners who've purchased a low-ticket product from me before"]
> Email Goal: [GET CLICKS / DRIVE SALES / RE-ENGAGE]
>
> Variables:
> - [OFFER DESCRIPTION]: e.g., "Black Friday sale: 40% off my online course on pricing strategy"
> - [TARGET AUDIENCE]: e.g., "coaches and consultants on my email list"
> - [EMAIL GOAL]: e.g., "drive sales before midnight Friday"

---

### Example Output

*For a Black Friday sale on an online business growth course*

1. **(Curiosity Gap)** The price drops at midnight. Here's why.
2. **(Urgency/Scarcity)** 9 hours left — then it's gone
3. **(Social Proof)** 847 people grabbed this. You haven't yet.
4. **(Benefit-Led)** Add $1K/mo in 30 days — or your money back
5. **(Personalization Hook)** This is for you (if you're not at $5K/mo yet)
6. **(Direct Question)** Ready to stop leaving money on the table?
7. **(How To)** How to add a revenue stream before December ends
8. **(Numbered List)** 3 reasons today's the day to buy this
9. **(Fear of Missing Out)** Your competitors are using this. You're not.
10. **(Humor/Unexpected)** This email is basically begging you to save money

---

**What this replaces:** An email marketing strategist would charge $150–$300 and spend a full afternoon building a subject line test set for a campaign launch. You just did it in 3 minutes.

---

## Prompt #3: Facebook Ad — Problem/Agitate/Solve Framework

**Replaces:** $200/hr direct-response copywriter, 2–4 hour project to write a tested PAS ad

---

### The Prompt

> Act as a direct-response Facebook ad copywriter who specializes in the Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) framework. Write a complete, ready-to-run Facebook ad for the product below using the PAS structure. Problem: open with a single painful problem your target audience faces — one sentence, no intro. Agitate: spend 2–3 sentences amplifying the emotional and practical cost of that problem (time lost, money wasted, confidence eroded). Solve: position the product as the specific, direct solution in 2–3 sentences. Close with one clear CTA sentence. Total primary text: 150–200 words. Also write a headline (under 40 characters) and a description line (under 30 characters).
>
> Product Name: [PRODUCT NAME]
> Target Audience: [WHO THIS IS FOR — be specific]
> Pain Point: [THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM THEY EXPERIENCE]
> How It Solves It: [HOW YOUR PRODUCT DIRECTLY ELIMINATES THE PAIN]
> Call to Action: [WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO]
>
> Variables:
> - [PRODUCT NAME]: e.g., "Momentum Fitness" (online fitness coaching)
> - [TARGET AUDIENCE]: e.g., "desk workers aged 30–45 who feel burnt out and out of shape"
> - [PAIN POINT]: e.g., "no energy, no time, no results despite trying multiple times"
> - [HOW IT SOLVES IT]: e.g., "30-minute home workouts designed specifically for people with desk jobs and no gym access"
> - [CALL TO ACTION]: e.g., "Start your free 7-day trial"

---

### Example Output

*For Momentum Fitness — online coaching for desk workers*

**Primary Text:**

You sit at a desk for 8 hours, come home exhausted, and the last thing you have energy for is a workout. So you skip it. Again. And again. And suddenly three months have gone by and nothing has changed — except you feel worse about it than you did before.

The problem isn't your willpower. The problem is you're following fitness programs built for people with gyms, free time, and 20-year-old bodies. None of those programs account for a back that aches from a chair, a schedule that leaves you 30 minutes on a good day, or a brain that's already spent by 6pm.

Momentum Fitness was built specifically for desk workers. 30-minute home workouts, no equipment, no commute. Programs designed around the exact limitations that make every other routine fail for people like you.

Start your free 7-day trial — no credit card required.

**Headline:** Built for desk workers.

**Description:** No gym. 30 mins. Real results.

---

**What this replaces:** A direct-response copywriter would charge $300–$600 and take several hours to research your audience and write a tested PAS Facebook ad. You just did it in 3 minutes.

---

## Prompt #4: Landing Page Hero Section

**Replaces:** $175/hr conversion copywriter, 3-hour project for a hero section that converts cold traffic

---

### The Prompt

> Act as a conversion copywriter who specializes in landing page optimization. Write a hero section for the landing page described below. The hero section must include: (1) a primary headline — one sentence, outcome-focused, under 12 words; (2) a subheadline — one to two sentences that clarify who this is for and what makes it different, under 30 words; (3) three benefit bullets — each one starting with a bolded micro-benefit (3–4 words), followed by a single explanatory sentence; (4) a CTA button label — action-oriented, under 5 words. Do NOT use the product name as the headline. Lead with transformation, not identity.
>
> Product Name: [PRODUCT NAME]
> Who It's For: [THE SPECIFIC AUDIENCE]
> Main Outcome: [THE TRANSFORMATION OR RESULT THE BUYER GETS]
> Time to Result: [HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN EXPECT IT]
> Unique Mechanism: [WHAT MAKES YOUR APPROACH DIFFERENT FROM ALTERNATIVES]
>
> Variables:
> - [PRODUCT NAME]: e.g., "ProposalKit" (freelance proposal template pack)
> - [WHO IT'S FOR]: e.g., "freelancers who lose deals because their proposals look amateur"
> - [MAIN OUTCOME]: e.g., "land higher-paying clients with proposals that look like agency work"
> - [TIME TO RESULT]: e.g., "send your first polished proposal in under 20 minutes"
> - [UNIQUE MECHANISM]: e.g., "pre-written value positioning language that removes the blank-page problem"

---

### Example Output

*For ProposalKit — freelance proposal template pack*

**Headline:**
Land higher-paying clients with proposals that close.

**Subheadline:**
ProposalKit gives freelancers agency-quality proposal templates with pre-written copy — so you stop losing deals to competitors who simply look more professional.

**Benefit Bullets:**
- **Send in 20 minutes.** Every template is pre-structured and pre-written — fill in your numbers, swap in your name, send. No more staring at a blank document.

## Prompt #5: Product Launch Email

**Replaces:** $250/hr launch copywriter, 3–5 hour project to write a launch day email that converts existing subscribers

---

### The Prompt

> Act as a product launch email copywriter. Write a launch day email for the product below, sent to an existing email list of warm subscribers who know the sender. Use the "here's what's inside" structure: open with a direct subject-line-to-email callback (1–2 sentences), explain what the product is in plain language (2–3 sentences), then list 3–4 specific "what's inside" items using bullets with brief context for each. Follow with a brief urgency block (1–2 sentences — limited time, limited bonus, or early-bird price). Close with a single CTA line. Sign-off should be personal and brief. Total length: 200–300 words. Do not use hype language or exclamation points.
>
> Product Name: [PRODUCT NAME]

> Price: [LAUNCH PRICE]

>
> Variables:

> - [MAIN BENEFIT]: e.g., "never stare at a blank caption box again"
> - [BONUS OFFER]: e.g., "30-day content calendar included free through Friday"
> - [CTA LINK]: e.g., "[CTA LINK]"

---

### Example Output

*For The Social Media Template Pack — launch to existing email list*

**Subject:** The Social Media Template Pack is live (and what's inside)

---

It's live.

Here's exactly what's inside:

- **120 caption templates** — organized into 12 categories (promotional, educational, storytelling, engagement-bait, product spotlight, and more). Fill in the blanks, post.
- **40 graphic layout specs** — Canva-compatible dimensions and composition guides for Reels covers, carousels, and feed posts. No design experience needed.
- **12 hashtag sets** — pre-researched by niche (coaching, e-commerce, service businesses, SaaS) with reach and engagement tier breakdowns.
- **30-Day Content Calendar (bonus)** — a Notion template that maps your templates to a full month of content. Included free through Friday.

The launch price is $37. It goes to $57 on Monday.

## What You Can't Do With Just 5 Prompts

These 5 prompts give you a taste of what's possible. But professional marketing requires a system — not 5 prompts, but 500+, organized by every channel you'll ever use.

Here's what 5 prompts can't cover:

1. **Ads (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn)** — These 5 prompts don't include Google search ad headlines, LinkedIn sponsored content, or retargeting ad copy
2. **Emails** — One launch email prompt doesn't cover welcome sequences, abandoned cart, re-engagement, or cold outreach
3. **Social Media** — Instagram captions are just one format — where are your LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, TikTok scripts, Pinterest descriptions?
4. **Landing Pages** — A hero section is just one component — what about feature bullets, FAQ sections, pricing copy, or CTA blocks?
5. **SEO** — No coverage of meta titles, meta descriptions, blog outlines, or pillar content structure
6. **Brand Strategy** — These prompts say nothing about positioning, brand voice, messaging hierarchy, or competitive differentiation
7. **Product Launch** — One launch email isn't a launch — you need pre-launch waitlist copy, announcement posts, Product Hunt copy, and post-launch follow-ups
8. **Video Scripts** — No YouTube intro hooks, VSL structure, Reels scripts, or tutorial outlines

The AI Marketing Prompt Kit covers all 8 categories — 500+ prompts, each with context, customizable variables, and expected output. Plus four Notion templates so you have the workspace to deploy everything you create.
