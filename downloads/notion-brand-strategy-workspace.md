# Brand Strategy Workspace
### AI Marketing Kit — Brand Foundation Template

---

> **How to use this workspace**
>
> Work through each section in order. Every section has placeholder text showing you the format — replace it with your own brand details. Use the AI prompts from **Category 6 (Brand Strategy)** in your prompt pack to generate first drafts of each section quickly. Once filled in, this document becomes the single source of truth for all your marketing: copy, ads, emails, and social content all derive from it.
>
> **Suggested workflow:** Complete Section 1 first (takes 30 minutes). Share with someone who knows your business and ask: "Does this sound like us?" Then work through Sections 2–6. Expect to revise multiple times — that's normal and healthy.

## 1. Brand Foundation

> **Purpose:** Defines why your business exists and what it stands for. Every piece of marketing should be traceable back to these statements.
>
> **AI Prompt tip:** Use prompts from Category 6 (Brand Strategy) — specifically the Mission Statement and Core Values prompts — to generate first drafts. Edit to match your authentic voice.

---

### Mission Statement

**Format:** We help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] by [HOW].

**Example:** We help early-stage founders achieve consistent revenue by giving them AI-powered marketing tools they can use without an agency.

**Your Mission:**

> We help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] by [HOW].

---

### Vision Statement

**Format:** In [TIME], [YOUR COMPANY] is known for [OUTCOME/LEGACY].

**Example:** In 3 years, the AI Marketing Kit is the first tool founders reach for when they need to market anything — because it works faster and better than any alternative at the price.

**Your Vision:**

> In [TIME], [YOUR COMPANY] is known for [OUTCOME/LEGACY].

---

### Core Values

**Instructions:** Choose 3–5 values that are genuinely true about how you operate — not aspirational, not generic. Each value should have a one-sentence explanation of what it means in practice.

| Value | What It Means in Practice |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Authenticity | We say what we mean and do what we say — in our content, our products, and our support. |
| Customer Obsession | Every decision starts with one question: "Does this help the customer get a better result?" |
| Clarity | We communicate simply and directly. If a sentence needs to be re-read to be understood, we rewrite it. |
| Consistency | We show up the same way every day — same voice, same standards, same commitment. |
| Results Over Optics | We measure what matters and cut what doesn't — even if it means abandoning something we like. |

**Your Core Values:**

## 2. Target Audience (Ideal Customer Profile)

> **Purpose:** A precise description of the one person you're writing every piece of content for. "Everyone" is not an audience. When your ICP is this specific, your content will resonate with thousands of people who see themselves in it.
>
> **AI Prompt tip:** Use the ICP prompts from Category 6. Input your product type and price point — the prompt will suggest demographic and psychographic attributes to investigate. Then validate by talking to 5 actual customers.

---

### Primary ICP: [Give this person a name, e.g., "Marketing Manager Maya"]

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Age Range** | 35–45 |
| **Location** | Remote / Work from home, US or UK based |
| **Job Title / Role** | Marketing Manager at a small company, or a Founder doing their own marketing |

| **Tech Comfort Level** | Comfortable with tools, but not a developer |

| **Frustrations** | Agency quotes are too expensive and unpredictable; hiring a copywriter takes too long; generic templates don't match their voice |
| **Buying Triggers** | Sees a peer achieving results; sees a before/after case study; finds out exactly how cheap it is vs. hiring someone |
| **Objections** | "Will this actually work for my industry?" / "I'm not sure I have time to learn this" / "Is this just more templates I'll never use?" |
| **Where They Hang Out Online** | LinkedIn (daily), email newsletters, Twitter/X (occasionally), YouTube for how-to content |
| **Preferred Content Format** | Long-form LinkedIn posts, practical email breakdowns, how-to YouTube videos |

## 3. Competitive Landscape

> **Purpose:** Understand what your competitors position themselves as — so you can position yourself as something different and better. You don't need to compete with them; you need to occupy a distinct position in the buyer's mind.
>
> **AI Prompt tip:** Use the Competitive Analysis prompts in Category 6. Input each competitor's name and product — the prompt will help you identify positioning gaps you can own.

---

### Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Price Point | Their Positioning | Our Differentiation |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| [Competitor A — e.g., generic AI writing tool] | Huge content library, strong SEO, name recognition | Generic output with no brand context; requires significant editing | Free + $20–$99/mo | "Write anything faster with AI" | Our prompts are marketing-specific and pre-engineered — users get usable output, not raw AI draft |
| [Competitor B — e.g., content calendar tool] | Beautiful UI, strong social proof, creator-focused | Template library feels generic after 30 days; no AI integration | $47 one-time or $29/mo | "Content calendars for creators who want to grow" | Our kit includes prompts + templates + strategy — not just a scheduling grid |
| [Competitor C — e.g., marketing course] | In-depth curriculum, strong community | Slow to apply; feels like school not a toolkit; dated in 12 months | $297–$997 one-time | "Learn marketing the right way" | Our product is a tool, not a course — buyers get results in Day 1, not after 20 hours of videos |

**Your Competitive Analysis:**

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Price Point | Their Positioning | Our Differentiation |

### Positioning Statement

**Format:** For [TARGET AUDIENCE] who [PROBLEM/NEED], [YOUR PRODUCT] is [CATEGORY] that [KEY BENEFIT]. Unlike [COMPETITORS], we [KEY DIFFERENTIATOR].

**Example:** For small business owners and founders who need to produce consistent marketing content without hiring an agency, the AI Marketing Kit is a complete prompt + template system that lets you create professional marketing in hours, not weeks. Unlike generic AI tools, every prompt is engineered specifically for marketing outcomes — so what comes out is usable on Day 1.

**Your Positioning Statement:**

> For [TARGET AUDIENCE] who [PROBLEM/NEED], [YOUR PRODUCT] is [CATEGORY] that [KEY BENEFIT]. Unlike [COMPETITORS], we [KEY DIFFERENTIATOR].

---

---

## 4. Brand Voice

> **Purpose:** A precise guide to how your brand writes and speaks. Without this, every piece of content sounds slightly different — which erodes trust over time. With this, every team member and AI tool you use will produce on-brand output.
>
> **AI Prompt tip:** Use the Brand Voice prompts in Category 6. Paste 3 pieces of content you love and 3 you don't — the prompt will identify patterns and produce a voice guide.

---

### Voice Attributes

**Tone Adjectives (3–5 words that describe how we write):**

> Direct, Warm, Authoritative, Practical, Honest

**We Sound Like:**

> A knowledgeable friend who has actually done this before — someone who gives you the real answer, not the safe corporate answer. Think "smart mentor" not "consultant billing by the hour."

**We Do NOT Sound Like:**

> A corporate press release. An overhyped sales pitch full of vague promises. An academic paper that requires a second read. Anything that starts with "In today's fast-paced digital landscape..."

---

### Brand Voice Do / Don't

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Use short, declarative sentences | Use jargon, buzzwords, or corporate speak |
| Name specific outcomes and numbers ("our open rate went from 18% to 41%") | Make vague promises ("take your marketing to the next level") |
| Address the reader directly ("you", "your") | Speak in the third person ("one should consider...") |
| Show the work — explain how and why | Just assert results without supporting them |
| Use real examples, even unflattering ones | Use polished hypotheticals that feel made-up |
| Take a clear stance on things | Hedge every claim with "it depends" |
| Write like you talk | Write like you're submitting a college essay |

---

### Voice Examples

| Situation | Off-Brand Version | On-Brand Version |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Describing the product | "Our comprehensive AI-powered marketing solution delivers best-in-class results for your business." | "500 marketing prompts, 4 Notion templates, and a system for producing consistent content — without an agency or a copywriter." |
| Product benefit | "Leverage cutting-edge artificial intelligence to streamline your content creation process." | "Write a month of social posts in an afternoon. Here's exactly how." |
| Addressing objections | "We understand your concerns about the investment." | "Worried it won't work for your industry? Here's what to check before you buy." |
| Social proof | "Trusted by thousands of marketing professionals worldwide." | "47 founders used this to plan their Q1 content in a single afternoon. Here's what they said." |
| CTA | "Click here to learn more about our solutions!" | "Download the kit and use it today. If it doesn't deliver, email us for a full refund." |

## 5. Visual Identity

> **Purpose:** Consistency in visual identity creates instant brand recognition. Even if you're not a designer, these decisions should be made once and applied everywhere.
>
> **AI Prompt tip:** Use the Visual Identity prompts in Category 6 to generate color palette suggestions, font pairings, and logo brief descriptions based on your brand adjectives and audience.

---

### Color Palette

| Color Role | Hex Code | Where It's Used | Sample Swatch |
|-----------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Primary** | #______ | Headlines, primary buttons, key UI elements | *(paste or describe)* |
| **Secondary** | #______ | Accent elements, secondary buttons, highlights | *(paste or describe)* |
| **Background** | #______ | Page backgrounds, card backgrounds | *(paste or describe)* |
| **Text** | #______ | Body copy, secondary text | *(paste or describe)* |
| **Danger / Alert** | #______ | Error states, warnings, urgency elements | *(paste or describe)* |

> *(Describe what mood or feeling these colors create, and why they fit your brand and ICP)*

---

### Typography

| Use Case | Font Name | Weight | Size (web default) | Where Used |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Headlines (H1)** | *(e.g., Montserrat)* | Bold (700) | 48px / 3rem | Page titles, section headers |
| **Subheadings (H2–H3)** | *(e.g., Montserrat)* | SemiBold (600) | 32px / 24px | Subsection headers, card titles |
| **Body Copy** | *(e.g., Inter)* | Regular (400) | 16px / 1rem | Paragraphs, descriptions, captions |
| **UI / Labels** | *(e.g., Inter)* | Medium (500) | 14px | Buttons, form labels, navigation |
| **Accent / Display** | *(optional — e.g., Playfair Display)* | — | — | Pull quotes, hero text treatments |

**Font pairing rationale:**

---

| **Icon / Mark** | *(Describe or paste: standalone icon for favicons, social profiles)* |
| **Wordmark** | *(Text-only version for small applications)* |
| **Logo Colors** | *(List which color versions exist: full color, white/reversed, black)* |
| **Minimum Size** | *(Smallest size at which the logo is still legible)* |
| **Clear Space** | *(Minimum space around the logo — often = height of logo's cap letter)* |
| **Usage Notes** | *(What NOT to do: stretch, rotate, change colors, apply drop shadows, etc.)* |

---

### Brand Imagery Style

**Photography / Illustration direction:**

> *(Describe the look and feel: e.g., "Clean, bright, modern. Real people in real workspaces — not stock photos of handshakes. Candid over posed. Natural light.")*

**What to avoid:**

> *(e.g., "No stock photo clichés — no hands on keyboards, no lightbulb graphics, no 'team celebrating around a laptop'. No dark or moody color grading.")*

---

---

## 6. Core Messaging

> **Purpose:** The exact words your brand uses to describe what it does and why it matters. Every ad, email subject line, landing page, and social post draws from this section. Getting this right is worth more than any design asset.
>
> **AI Prompt tip:** Use the Core Messaging prompts in Category 6 — specifically tagline generation, elevator pitch, and hero statement prompts. Run them 5 times and pick the best outputs to edit.

---

### Tagline

**Rules:** 5–10 words. Should communicate the end outcome, not the features. Should work without context.

**Examples to avoid:** "Your All-in-One Marketing Solution" (generic) / "Powered by AI" (feature, not outcome) / "Marketing Made Easy" (overused)

**Strong example:** "500 AI prompts. 90 days of content. No agency needed."

**Your Tagline:**

> *(Write your 5–10 word tagline here)*

---

### Elevator Pitch (30-Second Version)

**Format:** [WHO YOU HELP] + [PROBLEM THEY HAVE] + [WHAT YOU DO] + [HOW IT'S DIFFERENT] + [PROOF OR RESULT]

**Example:**

> "The AI Marketing Kit is for founders and small teams who need to produce professional marketing content but can't afford an agency or a full-time copywriter. It's a complete toolkit — 500 AI prompts, 4 Notion planning templates, and a system you can use on Day 1. Unlike general AI tools that just give you raw drafts to edit, every prompt in the kit is pre-engineered for specific marketing outcomes. Users typically plan a full month of content in under 4 hours."

**Your Elevator Pitch:**

> *(Write your 2–3 sentence elevator pitch here)*

---

### Hero Statement (Above the Fold)

**Rules:** One sentence. States the end result the buyer gets. No jargon. No features. Should make the right person stop scrolling.

**Examples:**
- "Plan 30 days of marketing content in one afternoon — without a copywriter."
- "500 AI prompts for every marketing asset your business needs."
- "Stop paying agency prices. Start producing agency-quality marketing yourself."

**Your Hero Statement:**

> *(Write your single hero statement here)*

---

### Key Proof Points

Three concrete statements that back up your hero claim. Each should be specific — numbers, results, or mechanisms, not vague assertions.

| # | Proof Point | Type |
|---|-------------|------|
| 1 | Customers report planning a full month of content in under 4 hours — vs. 2–3 days manually | Result |
| 2 | 500 prompts across 8 marketing categories — social, email, ads, SEO, landing pages, brand, product launch, and video | Specificity |
| 3 | 30-day money-back guarantee — if it doesn't work for your business, email us for a full refund | Risk reversal |

**Your Proof Points:**

| # | Proof Point | Type |
|---|-------------|------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |

### Objection Responses

Document your pre-written responses to the most common buyer objections. These go on your FAQ section, sales page, and DMs.

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|---------|
| "Will this work for my industry?" | "The prompts are written for marketing outcomes, not specific industries. The variables are yours to fill in — your audience, your product, your tone. If you sell services, products, or information, these prompts work." |
| "I'm not sure I have time to learn this." | "There's nothing to learn. Open the prompt, read the instructions (2–3 sentences), paste it into ChatGPT or Claude, edit the output. The first time takes 10 minutes. After that, 2–3 minutes per piece of content." |
| "I already use ChatGPT." | "ChatGPT is a tool. This kit is 500 pre-engineered marketing-specific prompts that tell ChatGPT exactly what to produce. Most people use ChatGPT and get 80% raw drafts that need heavy editing. These prompts are designed to give you 90%+ usable output." |
| "Is this just templates I won't use?" | "The prompts are organized by marketing goal, not content type. You use them when you need them — before writing an email, before planning a campaign, before writing ad copy. They don't expire and they don't require setup." |
