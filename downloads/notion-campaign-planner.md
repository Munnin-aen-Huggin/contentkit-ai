# Campaign Planner
### AI Marketing Kit — Campaign Management Template

---

> **How to use this planner**
>
> Add one row per campaign. Fill in the details as the campaign develops — you don't need all fields complete before adding it. Use the Campaign Brief Template section below for detailed pre-launch planning, and the Results Tracker to measure performance after launch.
>
> **Suggested workflow:** Add every campaign idea to the tracker (even rough ones) → fill in the brief before you start active work → update status weekly → complete the results tracker within 7 days of campaign end while data is fresh.
