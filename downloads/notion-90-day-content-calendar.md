# 90-Day Content Calendar
### AI Marketing Kit — Quarterly Content Planning Template

---

> **How to use this template**
>
> This calendar covers a full quarter (13 weeks) of marketing content. It's organized by week and themed by marketing goal — so your content builds momentum instead of repeating randomly. Clear the sample entries and replace them with your own, or use them as a starting framework.
>
> **Import into Notion:** Paste this file into any Notion page using the `/markdown` import block, or copy the tables directly. The Week and Theme/Campaign fields work best as group-by properties in Notion's Table and Timeline views.
