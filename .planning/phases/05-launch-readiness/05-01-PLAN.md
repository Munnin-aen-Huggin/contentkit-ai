<objective>
Configure all analytics and tracking prerequisites so the end-to-end verification test (Plan 05-02) can run with full conversion data flowing.

Purpose: Without Plausible goals, conversion events fire but are silently discarded. Without Stripe redirects with ?tier=, all purchases report $0 value. Without ad platform IDs, paid traffic conversion optimization cannot train. This plan ensures every tracking system is wired before the real-charge test.

Output: All HTML files updated with real tracking IDs (or confirmed deferred), Plausible goals created, Stripe redirects configured, changes pushed to GitHub Pages.

<task type="checkpoint:decision" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Ad platform tracking ID decision</name>
  <files>None -- decision only</files>
  <action>
Present the following decision to the user. All 8 HTML files contain placeholder IDs: `AW-XXXXXXXXXX` (Google Ads) and `PIXEL_ID_HERE` (Meta Pixel). These must be replaced with real IDs before any paid ad traffic runs. However, if the initial launch strategy is organic-only (Reddit, Twitter, Product Hunt -- which Phase 6 already prepared), these can be deferred until paid ads are needed.

Plausible analytics (tracking Purchase, Email Signup, Purchase Click) work independently of Google/Meta and are the primary analytics tool for organic traffic.

Current state:
- 8 files contain `AW-XXXXXXXXXX` (index.html, thank-you.html, blog/index.html, 5 blog articles)
- 8 files contain `PIXEL_ID_HERE` (same files)
- thank-you.html also has `AW-XXXXXXXXXX/CONVERSION_LABEL` placeholder

**Options:**

**Option A: replace-now** -- "I have Google Ads Conversion ID + Label and Meta Pixel ID ready."
Pros: Paid ads can run immediately after verification. Full conversion data from day one.
Cons: Requires Google Ads and Meta Business Manager accounts to be set up first.

**Option B: defer-ads** -- "Defer ad tracking. Launching with organic traffic only (Reddit, Twitter, Product Hunt)."
Pros: No account setup needed now. Plausible still tracks all conversions. Can add ad IDs later with a simple find-and-replace.
Cons: If you decide to run paid ads, you'll need to do the find-and-replace then.

**Option C: partial** -- "I have one but not the other. Provide what you have."
Pros: Replace what's available now.
Cons: Still need to come back for the other.
  </action>
  <verify>User has selected one of the three options and (if applicable) provided their tracking IDs.</verify>
  <done>Decision recorded. If "replace-now" or "partial", user has provided the relevant IDs for Task 2. If "defer-ads", Task 2 will skip file modifications and document the deferral. Resume signal: select replace-now (and provide IDs), defer-ads, or partial (and specify which + provide ID).</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Replace ad tracking placeholder IDs across all HTML files</name>
  <files>index.html, thank-you.html, blog/index.html, blog/ai-marketing-prompts.html, blog/ai-email-marketing-prompts.html, blog/ai-social-media-prompts.html, blog/ai-copywriting-prompts-free.html, blog/chatgpt-marketing-templates.html</files>
  <action>
Based on user's decision in Task 1:

**If "replace-now":** Use the provided Google Ads Conversion ID, Conversion Label, and Meta Pixel ID. Run find-and-replace across all 8 HTML files:
```bash
# Google Ads Conversion ID (in all 8 files -- gtag config):
find . -name "*.html" -exec sed -i '' "s/AW-XXXXXXXXXX/AW-REALID/g" {} +

# Google Ads Conversion Label (thank-you.html only -- conversion event send_to):
sed -i '' "s|AW-XXXXXXXXXX/CONVERSION_LABEL|AW-REALID/REALLABEL|g" thank-you.html

# Meta Pixel ID (in all 8 files -- fbq init + noscript img):
find . -name "*.html" -exec sed -i '' "s/PIXEL_ID_HERE/REALPIXELID/g" {} +
```

IMPORTANT: Replace the Conversion ID BEFORE replacing the Conversion ID/Label combo. The sed for `AW-XXXXXXXXXX/CONVERSION_LABEL` must run before the generic `AW-XXXXXXXXXX` replacement, otherwise the label pattern is destroyed. Correct order:
1. `AW-XXXXXXXXXX/CONVERSION_LABEL` -> `AW-REALID/REALLABEL` (thank-you.html only)
2. `AW-XXXXXXXXXX` -> `AW-REALID` (all files)
3. `PIXEL_ID_HERE` -> `REALPIXELID` (all files)

Verify no placeholders remain:
```bash
grep -r "AW-XXXXXXXXXX" --include="*.html" .
grep -r "PIXEL_ID_HERE" --include="*.html" .
grep -r "CONVERSION_LABEL" --include="*.html" .
```
All three greps should return zero results.

**If "defer-ads":** Skip file modifications. Document in SUMMARY that ad tracking IDs are deferred and reference `marketing/paid-ads/tracking-setup.md` for when the user is ready.

**If "partial":** Replace the available ID(s) using the same sed commands above. Leave the other placeholder(s) in place. Note which remains in SUMMARY.

After any file changes, commit and push to GitHub to trigger GitHub Pages redeploy:
```bash
git add [modified files]
git commit -m "feat(05-01): replace ad tracking placeholders with real IDs"
git push origin main
```
  </action>
  <verify>
If replaced:
- `grep -r "AW-XXXXXXXXXX" --include="*.html" .` returns zero results
- `grep -r "PIXEL_ID_HERE" --include="*.html" .` returns zero results
- `grep -r "CONVERSION_LABEL" --include="*.html" .` returns zero results (thank-you.html should have real label)

If deferred:
- Placeholders remain (expected) and decision is documented
  </verify>
  <done>Ad tracking IDs are either replaced across all 8 HTML files with real values, or explicitly deferred with documentation pointing to tracking-setup.md for future completion.</done>

  <name>Task 3: Configure Plausible goals and Stripe redirect URLs in dashboards</name>
  <files>No files modified -- dashboard configuration only</files>
  <action>
Three dashboard configurations are required. None can be automated via CLI/API.

**Step 1: Plausible Analytics Goals (plausible.io)**

1. Log in to plausible.io
2. Confirm `getcontentkit.com` appears in your sites list. If not, add it: + Add website > domain: getcontentkit.com
3. Go to getcontentkit.com site settings > Goals
4. Create goal 1: Click "+ Add goal" > Custom event > Event name: `Purchase` > Enable Revenue Tracking > Currency: USD > Save
5. Create goal 2: Click "+ Add goal" > Custom event > Event name: `Email Signup` > Save
6. Create goal 3: Click "+ Add goal" > Custom event > Event name: `Purchase Click` > Save
7. Verify all three goals appear in the Goals list

**IMPORTANT:** Event names must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive). The code fires `plausible('Purchase', ...)`, `plausible('Email Signup')`, and `plausible('Purchase Click')`.

**Step 2: Stripe Redirect URLs (dashboard.stripe.com)**

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Payment Links
2. Find the **Starter Kit** link (charges $147) -- edit it
3. Under "After payment" > select "Don't show confirmation page"
4. Set redirect URL to: `https://getcontentkit.com/thank-you.html?tier=starter`
5. Save
6. Find the **Full Kit** link (charges $499) -- edit it
7. Under "After payment" > select "Don't show confirmation page"
8. Set redirect URL to: `https://getcontentkit.com/thank-you.html?tier=full`
9. Save

**Step 3: Verify Stripe redirect works**

1. Open the Starter Payment Link URL in a browser (don't complete payment -- just verify the link loads Stripe checkout)
2. Optionally: Use Stripe test mode to confirm the redirect lands on `thank-you.html?tier=starter`
  </action>
  <verify>
Plausible: Visit getcontentkit.com site settings > Goals. Confirm three goals listed: Purchase (with revenue icon), Email Signup, Purchase Click.

Stripe: Open each Payment Link in the Stripe Dashboard and confirm redirect URL shows the correct thank-you.html URL with ?tier= parameter.
  </verify>
  <done>
Three Plausible goals created (Purchase with USD revenue tracking, Email Signup, Purchase Click). Both Stripe Payment Links configured to redirect to thank-you.html with correct ?tier= parameter. Dashboard configurations complete -- ready for end-to-end verification in Plan 05-02.

Resume signal: Type "configured" when all three steps are done, or describe any issues.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Ad tracking: Either real IDs are in all HTML files (grep returns zero placeholder matches) OR deferral is documented
2. Plausible: Three goals exist in dashboard matching exact event names from code
3. Stripe: Both Payment Links redirect to thank-you.html?tier=starter and thank-you.html?tier=full
4. If files were modified: changes committed and pushed, GitHub Pages redeployed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Plausible dashboard shows 3 custom goals (Purchase/revenue, Email Signup, Purchase Click)
- Stripe Payment Links redirect to thank-you.html with correct ?tier= parameters
- Ad tracking IDs either replaced or explicitly deferred
- All changes pushed to GitHub Pages and live
- INFRA-03 requirement satisfied (Plausible analytics configured)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-launch-readiness/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
