<objective>
Verify the complete purchase-to-delivery funnel under real conditions: real money, real device, real email providers. This is the final quality gate before the site accepts traffic.

Purpose: Every system has been built and configured individually. This plan verifies they work together as a chain. A single broken link (webhook fails, email goes to spam, redirect drops ?tier=) means lost revenue or corrupted analytics once traffic starts.

Output: Verified go/no-go status for accepting traffic. Either all checks pass and the site is cleared, or specific issues are identified and documented for remediation.

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Real charge end-to-end test</name>
  <files>No files modified</files>
  <action>
Complete a real purchase using a real credit/debit card (NOT Stripe test mode) to verify the entire chain works.

**Pre-flight check (do before charging):**
- Confirm 05-01 is complete: Plausible goals created, Stripe redirects configured with ?tier=
- Open browser DevTools Console on thank-you.html to observe conversion events

**Execute the test:**

1. Open `https://getcontentkit.com` in a browser
2. Click the "Get Starter Kit" button ($147) -- this opens Stripe checkout
3. Complete checkout with a real card
4. **IMMEDIATELY after payment:** observe where the browser redirects
   - EXPECTED: `https://getcontentkit.com/thank-you.html?tier=starter`
   - If redirected WITHOUT `?tier=starter` -- Stripe redirect config is wrong (go back to 05-01 Task 3)

5. **On thank-you.html, open DevTools Console and verify:**
   - `[Plausible] Purchase {revenue: {currency: "USD", amount: 147}}` appears (or similar)
   - `gtag conversion` or `fbq Purchase` events fire (if ad IDs were replaced in 05-01)
   - No JavaScript errors in Console

6. **Check Kit (within 5 minutes):**
   - Log in to kit.com (ConvertKit)
   - Search for the email address used to purchase
   - Verify the subscriber has the `purchased-starter` tag
   - If tag is MISSING after 5 minutes: check Netlify Function logs at https://app.netlify.com > gleeful-alfajores-fd284c > Functions > ls-webhook > logs

7. **Check email inbox:**
   - Verify a receipt/confirmation email arrives from Stripe
   - Note whether it arrives in Primary, Promotions, or Spam

8. **Issue Stripe refund immediately:**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard > Payments > find the test charge > Refund
   - Refund the full $147
   - Note: Stripe processing fee (approx $4.56) may or may not be returned

**Record results:**
- Redirect URL correct? (yes/no)
- Console events fired? (yes/no, list which ones)
- Kit tag applied? (yes/no, which tag)
- Email received? (yes/no, which folder)
- Refund issued? (yes/no)
  </action>
  <verify>
All 5 checks pass:
1. Redirect lands on thank-you.html?tier=starter
2. DevTools Console shows conversion events with $147 value
3. Kit shows purchased-starter tag on buyer email
4. Receipt email received
5. Refund issued in Stripe Dashboard
  </verify>
  <done>
Real charge test passed: payment processed, redirect correct, conversion events fired, Kit tagging worked, email delivered, refund issued.

Resume signal: Type "real-charge-passed" with your results, or describe failures.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Mobile device test and email deliverability verification</name>
  <files>No files modified</files>
  <action>
Test the complete user journey on a physical mobile device AND verify email deliverability to major providers.

**Part A: Mobile Device Test (physical iOS or Android device)**

Use a cellular connection (not WiFi) to simulate real user conditions.

1. Open `https://getcontentkit.com` on your phone's browser
2. Scroll through the entire page -- verify:
   - No horizontal scroll at any point
   - All text is readable without zooming
   - Images load and display correctly
   - FAQ accordion works (tap to expand/collapse)
3. Tap the email opt-in form
   - Verify the keyboard opens and the input field is visible (not hidden behind keyboard)
   - Enter a test email address and submit
4. Tap the "Get Starter Kit" button
   - Verify Stripe checkout loads on mobile
   - Verify all form fields (email, card) are tappable and usable
   - Do NOT complete this purchase (just verify the flow loads)
5. Tap the "Get Full Kit" button -- same verification
6. Scroll to footer -- tap Privacy Policy, Terms, Refund Policy links
   - Verify each legal page loads and is readable on mobile
7. Test the blog: navigate to a blog article and verify readability

**Part B: Email Deliverability Test**

Test with BOTH a Gmail and an Outlook/Hotmail address.

1. Submit the opt-in form on `https://getcontentkit.com` with a **Gmail address**
   - Time how long until the lead magnet email arrives
   - Note which tab it lands in: Primary / Promotions / Spam
   - Expected: arrives within 60 seconds in Primary or Promotions

2. Submit the opt-in form with an **Outlook/Hotmail address** (use a different browser or incognito)
   - Time how long until the lead magnet email arrives
   - Note whether it lands in Inbox / Junk / Other
   - Expected: arrives within 60 seconds in Inbox or Other

3. (Optional) Test spam score at mail-tester.com:
   - Go to mail-tester.com, get a unique test email address
   - Submit that address in the opt-in form
   - Check your score at mail-tester.com after 60 seconds
   - Target: 7/10 or higher

**Record results:**
- Mobile: any horizontal scroll? (yes/no)
- Mobile: forms usable? (yes/no)
- Mobile: Stripe checkout loads? (yes/no)
- Mobile: legal pages accessible? (yes/no)
- Gmail: delivery time + tab (e.g., "12 seconds, Primary")
- Outlook: delivery time + folder (e.g., "30 seconds, Inbox")
- (Optional) Mail-tester score
  </action>
  <verify>
Mobile: Full page scrolls vertically only, forms are usable, Stripe loads, legal pages accessible.
Email: Lead magnet arrives within 60 seconds to both Gmail and Outlook. Not in Spam.
  </verify>
  <done>
Mobile flow verified on physical device. Email deliverability confirmed for Gmail and Outlook.

Resume signal: Type "mobile-email-passed" with your results, or describe failures.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Link audit, analytics verification, and go/no-go decision</name>
  <files>No files modified</files>
  <action>
Final verification sweep across all pages and analytics, culminating in go/no-go decision.

**Part A: Production Link Audit**

Open each page on the live domain (`https://getcontentkit.com`) and verify every link works:

1. **index.html:**
   - Nav links (scroll to sections)
   - "Get Starter Kit" button -> opens Stripe checkout
   - "Get Full Kit" button -> opens Stripe checkout
   - Email opt-in form submits successfully
   - Footer: Privacy Policy link -> privacy-policy.html loads
   - Footer: Terms of Service link -> terms-of-service.html loads
   - Footer: Refund Policy link -> refund-policy.html loads
   - Footer: Contact/email link (if present)

2. **thank-you.html:**
   - Accessible via direct URL: `https://getcontentkit.com/thank-you.html`
   - No broken resource links (CSS, images)

3. **Legal pages (3 pages):**
   - Each loads without errors
   - "Back to home" or nav links work

4. **Blog pages:**
   - `https://getcontentkit.com/blog/` loads
   - Each of the 5 blog article links works
   - CTA buttons in blog articles link to index.html or Stripe checkout

**Part B: Analytics Dashboard Verification**

1. Open Plausible dashboard for getcontentkit.com
2. Verify:
   - Page views are being recorded (from your testing today)
   - Under "Goal Conversions": at least one Purchase event appears (from Task 1's real charge)
   - Purchase event shows revenue amount ($147)
   - If Email Signup goal exists: check if form submissions registered

3. (If ad IDs were replaced in 05-01) Open Google Ads and/or Meta Events Manager:
   - Verify conversion events are appearing (may take 24-48 hours)

**Part C: Go/No-Go Decision**

Review all results from Tasks 1-3:

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Real charge -> redirect correct | | |
| Real charge -> conversion events | | |
| Real charge -> Kit tagging | | |
| Real charge -> email receipt | | |
| Mobile flow clean | | |
| Gmail deliverability | | |
| Outlook deliverability | | |
| All links working | | |
| Plausible recording conversions | | |
| Ad tracking live (or deferred) | | |

**GO criteria:** All checks pass (or ad tracking explicitly deferred). The site is ready to accept organic traffic (Reddit, Twitter, Product Hunt per Phase 6 plans).

**NO-GO criteria:** Any critical failure -- redirect missing ?tier=, Kit tagging broken, emails going to spam, broken links on production. Document the failures and return to fix before accepting traffic.
  </action>
  <verify>
All links on production domain resolve without 404s. Plausible shows Purchase conversion with revenue. Go/no-go decision rendered.
  </verify>
  <done>
Link audit passed, analytics verified, go/no-go decision made. Phase 5 is complete if GO. If NO-GO, specific failures are documented for gap closure.

Resume signal: Type "GO" if all checks pass and site is cleared for traffic, or "NO-GO: [list failures]" to document what needs fixing.
  </done>
</task>
