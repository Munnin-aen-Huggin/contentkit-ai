<objective>
Create three legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Refund Policy) as static HTML files with the same nav/footer branding as the main site.

Purpose: Legal pages are required for Stripe compliance, customer trust, and the footer links in index.html. The refund policy explicitly states the 30-day money-back guarantee already advertised on the sales page.

Output: Three new HTML files at the project root, each with substantive legal text appropriate for a digital product business.
