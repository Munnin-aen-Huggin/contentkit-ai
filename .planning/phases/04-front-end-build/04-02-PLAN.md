<objective>
Build the complete thank-you.html page that Stripe redirects to after purchase. Replace the current stub with a fully branded page that confirms the purchase, provides clear instructions (check email for download links), and matches the visual design of index.html.

Purpose: This is the first page a paying customer sees after checkout. It must reassure them the purchase succeeded, tell them exactly where to find their downloads, and maintain brand consistency.

Output: A complete `thank-you.html` with confirmation message, download instructions, social sharing prompt, and consistent nav/footer.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build complete thank-you page with download instructions and branding</name>
  <files>thank-you.html</files>
  <action>
Replace the entire content of thank-you.html with a complete page that includes:

**Head section:**
- Same charset, viewport, and font loading as index.html (preconnect + link pattern, NOT @import)
- Title: "Thank You — ContentKit AI"
- Meta description: "Thank you for purchasing ContentKit AI. Check your email for download links."
- Link to output.css
- Same custom CSS block as index.html (gradient-text, glow, etc.)
- No OG tags needed (this page should not be shared socially)
- Add `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` to prevent search engine indexing of this confirmation page

**Nav (same as index.html):**
- Fixed top, bg-dark-900/80 backdrop-blur, border-b
- Logo "ContentKit AI" linking to index.html
- CTA button removed (buyer already purchased — no need for CTA in nav)

**Main content — centered confirmation section:**
- Large green checkmark icon (use HTML entity or SVG circle with checkmark)
- Heading: "You're In! Check Your Email"
- Subheading paragraph: "Your purchase was successful. We're sending your download links to the email you used at checkout."

**"What happens next" steps (3-step visual):**
- Step 1: "Check Your Inbox" — "Look for an email from ContentKit AI with your download links. Check spam/promotions if you don't see it within 5 minutes."
- Step 2: "Download Your Files" — "Click the download links in your email to get your AI Prompt Kit PDF and Notion templates."
- Step 3: "Start Creating" — "Open any prompt, fill in your business details, paste into ChatGPT or Claude, and watch the magic happen."

Style each step as a card with a step number badge (1, 2, 3) using brand-500 for the badge background.

**Help section:**
- Small text: "Didn't receive your email? Check your spam folder or contact us at support@contentkit.ai"
- "Back to ContentKit AI" link pointing to index.html

**Optional social sharing prompt:**
- Subtle section: "Know someone who'd love this?" with a text prompt to share, not social buttons (keep it simple)

**Footer (same structure as index.html):**
- Copyright, Terms link (terms-of-service.html), Privacy link (privacy-policy.html), Refunds link (refund-policy.html), Contact link
- Same styling as index.html footer

Use the same Tailwind classes and dark theme as index.html. The page should feel like a natural continuation of the purchase flow. Full-width centered layout, max-w-2xl for the main content area.

Do NOT include Alpine.js script tag — this page has no interactive elements requiring Alpine.

  </verify>
  <done>thank-you.html is a complete, branded post-purchase page with confirmation message, 3-step download instructions, help contact, and consistent nav/footer. Page is excluded from search engines via noindex.</done>
</task>
