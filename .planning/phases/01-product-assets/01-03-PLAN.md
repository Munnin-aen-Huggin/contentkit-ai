<objective>
Write the lead magnet PDF content ("5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter") using deliberate gap engineering, then produce the asset manifest documenting every product URL and file path for Phase 3 Kit email setup.

Purpose: The lead magnet is the primary list-building tool and the first impression of product quality. It must demonstrate real value while making the gap to the full product obvious. The asset manifest is the handoff document that Phase 3 uses to wire delivery.

Output:
- `downloads/lead-magnet-content.md` — complete 8-12 page lead magnet content in Markdown
- `downloads/asset-manifest.md` — all Phase 1 asset URLs/paths in one place, ready for Kit emails

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write lead magnet PDF content with gap engineering</name>
  <files>downloads/lead-magnet-content.md</files>
  <action>
Create `downloads/lead-magnet-content.md` — the complete content for the "5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter" lead magnet PDF. This is an 8-12 page document (in Markdown, each section = ~1 PDF page).

**Psychological architecture (follow this structure exactly):**

```
Page 1: Cover
Page 2: Why Most Marketing Copy Fails (credibility setup)
Page 3: Prompt #1 — the easiest win
Page 4: Prompt #2 — email subject lines
Page 5: Prompt #3 — Facebook ad copy
Page 6: Prompt #4 — landing page hero section
Page 7: Prompt #5 — product launch email
Page 8: What You Can't Do With Just 5 Prompts (the gap)
Page 9: The Full AI Marketing Prompt Kit (CTA)
```

**Page-by-page content instructions:**

**Page 1 — Cover:**
```markdown
# Cover

**Title:** 5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter
**Subtitle:** Copy-paste these into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini — and get professional marketing copy in under 5 minutes
**By:** ContentKit AI
**tagline:** From the creators of the AI Marketing Prompt Kit
```

**Page 2 — Why Most Marketing Copy Fails:**
Write 3 short paragraphs (5-6 sentences each) making the case that:
- Most business owners write copy that's too vague, too feature-focused, or sounds like everyone else
- Hiring a copywriter solves it but costs $3K-$8K per project (cite plausible ranges)
- AI can produce 80% of a professional copywriter's output IF you give it the right structure — which is what these 5 prompts do

Close with: "These aren't generic prompts. Each one is engineered to produce a specific output for a specific marketing task — with variables you fill in for your business."

**Pages 3-7 — One Prompt Per Page:**

For EACH of the 5 prompts, follow this exact structure:

```markdown
## Prompt #[N]: [Descriptive Title]

**Replaces:** [Job description of what this prompt automates, e.g., "$150/hr conversion copywriter, 3-hour project"]

---

### The Prompt

> Act as a [ROLE]. [Full prompt text with bracketed variables in ALL CAPS]
>
> Variables:
> - [VARIABLE 1]: [example]
> - [VARIABLE 2]: [example]

---

### Example Output

[Write a realistic 150-300 word example output as if generated by AI for a fictional business.
Use a concrete example business — e.g., "Momentum Fitness" (online fitness coaching) or "Clearline" (invoicing software for freelancers).
The example output should be polished, professional, and immediately usable.]

---

**What this replaces:** A copywriter would charge $[plausible amount] and take [plausible time] to write this. You just did it in 3 minutes.
```

**The 5 specific prompts to write (one per page):**

Prompt #1 — Instagram Caption Hook Sequence
- What it does: Generates 5 hook variations for an Instagram post for one offer/product, each using a different hook type (question, bold statement, story opener, controversial take, "what if")
- Why easiest win: Fast, visual, immediately testable, works for any business
- Variables: [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME], [TARGET AUDIENCE], [MAIN BENEFIT]
- Example output: 5 Instagram hooks for "Clearline" invoicing software targeting freelancers

Prompt #2 — Email Subject Line Generator
- What it does: Generates 10 subject line variations for a promotional email using different copywriting angles (curiosity, urgency, social proof, benefit-led, personalization, question)
- Variables: [OFFER DESCRIPTION], [TARGET AUDIENCE], [EMAIL GOAL: get clicks / drive sales / re-engage]
- Example output: 10 subject lines for a Black Friday sale for an online course business

Prompt #3 — Facebook Ad (Problem/Agitate/Solve)
- What it does: Writes a complete 150-200 word Facebook ad using the PAS framework
- Variables: [PRODUCT NAME], [TARGET AUDIENCE], [PAIN POINT], [HOW PRODUCT SOLVES IT], [CTA]
- Example output: PAS Facebook ad for Momentum Fitness targeting burnt-out desk workers

Prompt #4 — Landing Page Hero Section
- What it does: Writes a headline + subheadline + 3 bullet benefit statements for a landing page hero
- Variables: [PRODUCT NAME], [WHO IT'S FOR], [MAIN OUTCOME], [TIME TO RESULT], [UNIQUE MECHANISM]
- Example output: Hero section for a freelance proposal template product

Prompt #5 — Product Launch Email
- What it does: Writes a launch day email to an existing email list announcing a new product (using the "here's what's inside" structure with a strong close)
- Variables: [PRODUCT NAME], [PRODUCT DESCRIPTION], [PRICE], [MAIN BENEFIT], [BONUS OFFER if any], [CTA LINK PLACEHOLDER]
- Example output: Launch email for a new social media template pack

**Page 8 — What You Can't Do With Just 5 Prompts (THE GAP):**

This is the most important page. Write it like this:

Opening paragraph: "These 5 prompts give you a taste of what's possible. But professional marketing requires a system — not 5 prompts, but 500+, organized by every channel you'll ever use."

Then write: "Here's what 5 prompts can't cover:"

List the 8 categories by name with a one-line description of what's missing:
1. Ads — "These 5 prompts don't include Google search ad headlines, LinkedIn sponsored content, or retargeting ad copy"
2. Emails — "One launch email prompt doesn't cover welcome sequences, abandoned cart, re-engagement, or cold outreach"
3. Social Media — "Instagram captions are just one format — where are your LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, TikTok scripts, Pinterest descriptions?"
4. Landing Pages — "A hero section is just one component — what about feature bullets, FAQ sections, pricing copy, or CTA blocks?"
5. SEO — "No coverage of meta titles, meta descriptions, blog outlines, or pillar content structure"
6. Brand Strategy — "These prompts say nothing about positioning, brand voice, messaging hierarchy, or competitive differentiation"
7. Product Launch — "One launch email isn't a launch — you need pre-launch waitlist copy, announcement posts, Product Hunt copy, and post-launch follow-ups"
8. Video Scripts — "No YouTube intro hooks, VSL structure, Reels scripts, or tutorial outlines"

Close: "The AI Marketing Prompt Kit covers all 8 categories — 500+ prompts, each with context, customizable variables, and expected output. Plus four Notion templates so you have the workspace to deploy everything you create."

  <name>Task 2: Write asset manifest for Phase 3 Kit email wiring</name>
  <files>downloads/asset-manifest.md</files>
  <action>
Create `downloads/asset-manifest.md` — the single reference document that Phase 3 (Email Automation) will use to wire Kit delivery sequences. This document must contain every URL and file path needed to embed in Kit emails.

**Important:** PDF URLs follow the Cloudflare Pages structure from the research. Domain placeholder is `yourdomain.com` — Phase 2 will establish the real domain. Use the placeholder format consistently so Phase 3 can do a find-replace when the real domain is known.

**File content:**

```markdown
# Asset Manifest — ContentKit AI Phase 1

Generated: [today's date]
Status: PDFs are local files ready to commit to repo. URLs become live after Phase 2 deploys to Cloudflare Pages.
Domain placeholder: yourdomain.com (replace with real domain after Phase 2)

## Phase Handoff Notes

Phase 2 (Infrastructure) needs:
- The `downloads/` folder committed to the repo so Cloudflare Pages serves the files
- Real domain name — replace all `yourdomain.com` placeholders in this manifest

Phase 3 (Email Automation) needs:
- This entire manifest
- Notion template URLs filled in (from 01-02 task)
- Real domain to finalize download links

Phase 4 (Front-End) needs:
- Stripe Payment Link URLs (created in Phase 2) to replace button placeholders
- Lead magnet PDF URL for opt-in form confirmation
```

After writing the file, scan `downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md` to confirm the 8 category names match exactly what's written in the Table of Contents section of the lead magnet gap page. Update the asset manifest if category names differ.
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# File exists
ls -la downloads/asset-manifest.md

# Both product tiers documented
grep "Starter" downloads/asset-manifest.md
grep "Full Kit" downloads/asset-manifest.md

# Kit tags defined
grep "purchased-starter" downloads/asset-manifest.md
grep "purchased-full-kit" downloads/asset-manifest.md

# Email copy templates present
grep "post-purchase-starter" downloads/asset-manifest.md
grep "post-purchase-full-kit" downloads/asset-manifest.md
grep "lead-magnet-delivery" downloads/asset-manifest.md

# Phase handoff notes present
grep "Phase 2" downloads/asset-manifest.md
grep "Phase 3" downloads/asset-manifest.md
```
All checks must pass. Three email sequences must be present with body copy.
  </verify>
  <done>
`downloads/asset-manifest.md` exists with:
- All 3 PDF asset paths and URL patterns documented
- Notion template URL table (ready to fill in after Plan 02)
- Both product tiers with their delivery contents listed
- Kit tag names defined for both tiers plus lead magnet
- Email copy templates for all 3 Kit sequences (lead-magnet-delivery, post-purchase-starter, post-purchase-full-kit)
- Phase handoff notes for Phase 2 and Phase 3
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. `downloads/lead-magnet-content.md` has 5 complete prompts with real example outputs (not placeholders)
2. Lead magnet gap page names all 8 categories and shows the Full Kit Table of Contents
3. None of the 5 lead magnet prompts appears verbatim in `downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md`
4. `downloads/asset-manifest.md` contains all 3 PDF paths, both product tier definitions, Kit tag names, and all 3 email sequence templates
5. Notion template URLs from Plan 02 are filled in to the asset manifest (if Plan 02 is complete) or clearly marked as pending
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Lead magnet: 9-section structure present, 5 prompts with real outputs, gap engineering correct (8 categories named, ToC shown), CTA with both pricing tiers
- Asset manifest: All Phase 1 assets catalogued, Kit tags defined, email body copy ready, phase handoff notes clear
- Both files ready to hand to the Phase 3 executor without additional content decisions required
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-product-assets/01-03-SUMMARY.md` following the summary template. Note in the summary whether Notion template URLs have been filled in to the asset manifest or whether they are still pending from Plan 02.
