<objective>
Produce a complete build specification for the four Notion templates, then have the user build and publish each template in Notion. Verify duplication works from a fresh Notion account.

Purpose: Notion templates cannot be created via CLI or API — they require human interaction in the Notion GUI. Claude produces a precise build spec so the user can execute quickly without guessing structure, properties, or content. Verification confirms buyer experience works before the asset is committed to Kit emails.

Output:
- `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md` — complete build guide for all 4 templates
- 4 public Notion template URLs (recorded in spec file after user builds them)

  <name>Task 1: Write Notion template build specification</name>
  <files>downloads/notion-templates-spec.md</files>
  <action>
Create `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md` — a step-by-step build guide for all four Notion templates. The user will follow this document while working in Notion. Every property name, type, option value, and view configuration must be specified exactly so the user does not need to make decisions while building.

**Critical rule from research (apply everywhere):** Use INLINE databases only. Never use "Linked View of database." This is the #1 buyer-facing failure mode.

**File structure:**
```markdown
# Notion Template Build Guide

## Before You Start
- Open Notion in browser (not desktop app — share button behavior differs)
- Create a new page in your workspace for each template
- Name each page exactly as specified (this becomes the public page title)
- After building each template, publish it, then paste the public URL into this document

## Template 1: 30-Day Content Calendar
## Template 2: 90-Day Content Calendar
## Template 3: Brand Strategy Workspace
## Template 4: Campaign Planner

## Publishing Each Template (do this after building each one)
## Testing with a Fresh Notion Account
## URL Registry (fill in after publishing)
```

**Template 1: 30-Day Content Calendar**
Page title: "30-Day Content Calendar — AI Marketing Kit"

Database: Create inline full-page database (not a linked view). Name: "Content Calendar"
Properties (add in this order):
- Title (default text property — rename to "Post Title")
- Date (Date type) — label: "Publish Date"
- Status (Select type) — options: Idea (gray), Drafting (yellow), Scheduled (blue), Published (green)
- Platform (Multi-select type) — options: Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook, YouTube, Email, TikTok, Pinterest
- Content Type (Select type) — options: Post, Reel/Short, Thread, Email, Video, Carousel, Story
- Prompt Used (Text type) — label: "Prompt Used"
- Notes (Text type) — label: "Notes"

Views to create:
1. Table (default) — show all properties, sort by Publish Date ascending
2. Calendar — group by Publish Date field
3. Board — group by Status, show Title and Platform

Pre-fill with 30 sample entries. Use realistic but generic content:
- Dates: spread across a single calendar month (use any month — buyer will clear and refill)
- Titles: make them realistic marketing content ("5 Mistakes New Entrepreneurs Make", "Behind-the-scenes: Our product development process", etc.)
- Status: mix of Idea (10), Drafting (8), Scheduled (7), Published (5)
- Platform: vary — some Instagram, some LinkedIn, some Email
- Content Type: mix of Post, Email, Reel/Short, Thread

**Template 2: 90-Day Content Calendar**
Page title: "90-Day Content Calendar — AI Marketing Kit"

Database: Same structure as 30-Day Calendar, plus these additional properties:
- Quarter (Select type) — options: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
- Theme/Campaign (Text type) — label: "Theme / Campaign"
- Goal (Select type) — options: Brand Awareness, Lead Generation, Engagement, Sales Conversion, Retention

Views to create:
1. Table (default) — all properties, sort by Publish Date
2. Calendar — group by Publish Date
3. Gallery — group by Platform (set cover: none, show Title and Publish Date)
4. Timeline — start: Publish Date, end: Publish Date (shows as single-day tasks)

Pre-fill with 90 sample entries organized across 13 weeks. Use the same realistic generic titles. Vary the Quarter field (Q1 for first 45, Q2 for remaining 45 or choose whichever quarter the user is currently in + next).

**Template 3: Brand Strategy Workspace**
Page title: "Brand Strategy Workspace — AI Marketing Kit"

This template is page-based, not database-primary. Structure:

```
Brand Strategy Workspace — AI Marketing Kit
├── [Instructions callout block]: "Fill in each section for your brand. Use the AI prompts from Category 6 (Brand Strategy) in your prompt pack to generate first drafts."
│
├── ## 1. Brand Foundation
│   ├── Mission: [placeholder text: "We help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] by [HOW]."]
│   ├── Vision: [placeholder: "In 5 years, [YOUR COMPANY] is known for..."]
│   └── Core Values: [Simple bulleted list with 5 placeholder values]
│
├── ## 2. Target Audience (Ideal Customer Profile)
│   └── [Inline table with columns: Attribute | Detail]
│       Rows: Age Range, Location, Job Title / Role, Income Level, Goals, Frustrations, Buying Triggers, Where They Hang Out Online
│       Pre-fill with example: "35-45 | Remote | Marketing Manager | $75K-$120K | Grow pipeline with less budget | Agency quotes too expensive | See ROI fast | LinkedIn + newsletters"
│
├── ## 3. Competitive Landscape
│   └── [Inline table with columns: Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Price Point | Their Positioning]

│   └── [Small table: DO | DON'T with 5 example pairs]
│
├── ## 5. Visual Identity
│   ├── Primary Color: [hex placeholder #______]
│   ├── Secondary Color: [hex placeholder #______]
│   ├── Font — Headlines: [placeholder]
│   ├── Font — Body: [placeholder]
│   └── Logo Notes: [text area]
│
└── ## 6. Core Messaging
    ├── Tagline: [placeholder]
    ├── Elevator Pitch (30 sec): [placeholder]
    ├── Key Proof Points: [3 bullet placeholders]
    └── Hero Statement (for landing page): [placeholder]
```

Note: All tables in this template must be Notion's inline "Simple Table" blocks (not databases). Databases are overkill and create duplication complexity for a page-based document.

**Template 4: Campaign Planner**
Page title: "Campaign Planner — AI Marketing Kit"

Database: Create inline full-page database. Name: "Campaigns"
Properties:
- Title (default) — rename to "Campaign Name"
- Launch Date (Date type)
- End Date (Date type)
- Status (Select) — options: Idea (gray), Planning (blue), Active (green), Paused (yellow), Complete (purple), Cancelled (red)
- Goal (Select) — options: Brand Awareness, Lead Generation, Sales Conversion, Retention/Loyalty, Product Launch
- Platform (Multi-select) — same options as Content Calendar
- Budget (Number type) — format: Dollar
- Owner (Text type) — label: "Owner / Lead"
- Notes (Text type)

Views to create:
1. Table (default) — all properties, sort by Launch Date
2. Board — group by Status
3. Calendar — by Launch Date field

Sub-pages (create as separate pages at the template root level, not inside the database):
- "Campaign Brief Template" — a simple page with sections: Campaign Name, Objective, Target Audience, Key Messages, Budget, Timeline, Success Metrics, Assets Needed
- "Results Tracker" — a simple inline Simple Table with columns: Metric, Target, Actual, Notes; pre-fill with sample rows: Impressions, Clicks, CTR, Leads, Conversions, CPA, Revenue

Pre-fill with 5 sample campaign entries.

**Publishing steps to include in the spec file (checklist format):**
```
Publishing Steps (do for each template):
1. Click "Share" button (top right of Notion page)
2. Click "Publish" tab
3. Click "Publish to web"
4. Confirm "Allow duplicate as template" toggle is ON
5. Copy the public URL
6. Paste URL into the URL Registry section of this document
```

**URL Registry section at bottom of spec file:**
```markdown
## URL Registry

Fill in after publishing each template:

| Template | Public URL | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| 30-Day Content Calendar | [paste URL] | [ ] Tested |
| 90-Day Content Calendar | [paste URL] | [ ] Tested |

- Critical linked-view warning prominently placed
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Build, publish, and verify all four Notion templates</name>
  <action>
Human action required — Notion has no CLI or API for template creation. Claude cannot operate the Notion GUI. The user must build all four templates manually using the spec file from Task 1.

Steps:
1. Open `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md` and follow it section by section
2. For each template: create the Notion page, add all specified databases/properties/views, add pre-filled sample content, publish via Share → Publish → "Allow duplicate as template" ON, copy the public URL into the URL Registry in the spec file
3. After all four are published, test duplication from a fresh Notion account (incognito + secondary email login): open each URL, click Duplicate, confirm it creates an independent copy in the fresh workspace
4. Critical data isolation test: in the duplicated database, add a new row — confirm it does NOT appear in the creator account's database (if it does, the template is a Linked View; rebuild with inline database)
  </action>
  <verify>
After user completion:
- `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md` URL Registry has all 4 URLs filled in and marked Tested
- Each URL resolves to a public Notion page with a visible Duplicate button
- Duplication into a fresh Notion account produces an independent workspace copy
- Data added to duplicated database does not appear in creator account
  </verify>
  <done>
All four Notion template public URLs are recorded in `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md` URL Registry, each marked as Tested, and duplication from a fresh account confirmed working for all four templates.
  </done>
  <what-to-do>
Build all four Notion templates in your Notion account following `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md` exactly, publish each one, fill in the URL Registry, then verify duplication from a fresh account.

**Step-by-step:**

1. Open `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md` in a text editor.

2. For each template (complete one fully before starting the next):
   a. Create a new Notion page with the exact title from the spec
   b. Build the database or page structure exactly as specified (properties, types, option values, views)
   c. Add the pre-filled sample entries/content specified
   d. Publish it: Share → Publish → Publish to web → confirm "Allow duplicate as template" is ON
   e. Copy the public URL and paste it into the URL Registry table in the spec file

3. After all four templates are published, test duplication:
   a. Open a private/incognito browser window
   b. Log in to a DIFFERENT Notion account (create one with a secondary email if needed)
   c. Open each template URL in that fresh account
   d. Click "Duplicate" (appears at top right)
   e. Confirm: the duplicated page appears in the fresh workspace, the database has sample entries that you can edit, and no errors appear
   f. Mark each template as "Tested" in the URL Registry

4. Save `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md` with the URLs filled in.

**Critical check before finishing:** Open any duplicated database in the fresh account, add a new row, confirm it does NOT appear in your creator account's database. If it does, the template is using a Linked View — rebuild it with an inline database.

**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours for all four templates.
  </what-to-do>
  <resume-signal>
Type "templates done" and paste the 4 public Notion template URLs, or describe any issues encountered.
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md` exists with all 4 template specs and URL Registry filled in
2. All 4 Notion template URLs are recorded in the URL Registry
3. Each URL resolves to a public Notion page with "Duplicate" button visible
4. Opening a template URL in a fresh Notion account and clicking Duplicate produces a working private copy
5. No database data from the creator account bleeds into the duplicated copy
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 4 public Notion template URLs documented in `downloads/notion-templates-spec.md`
- All 4 templates verified as duplicatable from a fresh Notion account
- Inline databases confirmed (not linked views)
- URL Registry table complete — ready to paste into Kit automation emails
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-product-assets/01-02-SUMMARY.md` following the summary template. Include all four Notion template URLs in the summary.
</output>
