<objective>
Write the complete AI marketing prompt pack content for both the Full Kit (500+ prompts) and the Starter tier (200 prompts). This is the core product — the primary deliverable buyers receive.

Purpose: Without content, no product exists. This plan produces the authoritative prompt content that gets designed into PDFs and referenced in all sales copy.

Output:
- `downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md` — 500+ structured prompts across 8 categories
- `downloads/ai-prompt-kit-starter-content.md` — 200 prompts (25 per category), subset of Full Kit

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write Full Kit prompt content (500+ prompts, 8 categories)</name>
  <files>downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md</files>
  <action>
Create `downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md` with 500+ marketing prompts organized across the 8 required categories. Each prompt MUST follow the exact three-field structure from the research — no exceptions:

```
### [PROMPT TITLE]

**CONTEXT:**
[When to use this prompt, what situation it's designed for, 2-3 sentences]

**PROMPT:**
Act as a [ROLE]. [The full prompt text with capitalized variable placeholders in brackets like [PRODUCT NAME], [TARGET AUDIENCE], etc.]

**VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:**
- [VARIABLE NAME] — [what to replace it with, concrete example]
- [VARIABLE NAME] — [what to replace it with, concrete example]

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
[What the AI will produce: format, length, tone, structure. Specific enough that the buyer knows what to expect before running it.]
```

File structure:
```
# AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Full Kit (500+ Prompts)

## How to Use This Pack
[3 paragraphs: what these prompts do, how to fill in variables, what to do when output needs refinement]

## Table of Contents
[List all 8 categories with prompt count and page anchor]

---

## Category 1: Ads (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn)
[Header page text — 2 sentences on what this category covers]

### [Prompt entries...]

---

## Category 2: Emails
[...]
```

**Category targets (minimum prompt counts):**
1. Ads (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn) — 65 prompts
   - Facebook ads: PAS, AIDA, benefit-driven, retargeting, lookalike, video scripts for ads, lead gen
   - Google ads: search headlines, descriptions, responsive ad variants, shopping ad copy
   - LinkedIn ads: thought leadership, lead gen form copy, InMail, sponsored content
2. Emails — 65 prompts
   - Welcome sequences, abandoned cart, re-engagement, promotional, nurture, sales, cold outreach, referral request
3. Social Media — 65 prompts
   - Instagram captions, LinkedIn posts, Twitter/X threads, TikTok scripts, Pinterest descriptions, carousel copy
4. Landing Pages — 60 prompts
   - Hero headline + subhead, feature-to-benefit bullets, social proof blocks, FAQ sections, CTA copy, above-the-fold copy, pricing page copy
5. SEO — 60 prompts
   - Meta titles, meta descriptions, blog post outlines, pillar content structures, internal linking anchor text, product page descriptions, FAQ schema content
6. Brand Strategy — 55 prompts
   - Brand positioning statement, messaging hierarchy, tone-of-voice guide, ICP definition, competitive differentiation, brand story, value proposition
7. Product Launch — 65 prompts
   - Pre-launch waitlist copy, launch day email, Product Hunt post, press release, announcement social posts, post-launch follow-up, referral ask
8. Video Scripts — 65 prompts
   - YouTube intro/hook, tutorial script outline, VSL structure, Reels/TikTok 30-sec scripts, testimonial video prompts, product demo scripts

**Quality standard (non-negotiable):**
- Every prompt must be specific enough to produce a meaningfully better output than typing the question directly into ChatGPT/Claude
- Prompts like "Write a Facebook ad about [PRODUCT]" are REJECTED — they must specify structure (PAS/AIDA/etc.), target audience role, tone, and length
- Variables must be concrete with examples: "[TARGET AUDIENCE] — e.g., 'freelance graphic designers charging under $50/hr'" not just "[TARGET AUDIENCE]"
- Expected Output must name format AND structure: "A 3-paragraph Facebook ad" not "A Facebook ad"

**Generation approach:** Write prompts category by category. For each category, write 10 prompts, check quality against the standard above, then continue. Favor depth of variation within each category (different frameworks, different funnel stages, different formats) over breadth.

Do NOT include any Notion template content or lead magnet content in this file.

Run the following checks:
```bash
# Count prompt entries (each starts with "### ")
grep -c "^### " downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md

# Confirm all 8 category headers exist
grep "^## Category" downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md

# Confirm all three structural fields are present throughout

grep -c "^\*\*VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:\*\*" downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md
grep -c "^\*\*EXPECTED OUTPUT:\*\*" downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md
```
All four field counts must be equal (one of each per prompt entry). Prompt count must be >= 500.

File exists at `downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md` with:
- 500+ prompt entries (### headings)
- All 8 category sections present
- Every prompt has all four fields: CONTEXT, PROMPT, VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE, EXPECTED OUTPUT
- No prompt is a generic skeleton ("Write X about [TOPIC]") — all are structurally specific
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Extract Starter tier (200 prompts, 25 per category)</name>
  <files>downloads/ai-prompt-kit-starter-content.md</files>
  <action>
Create `downloads/ai-prompt-kit-starter-content.md` by selecting exactly 25 prompts per category from the Full Kit content. Total: 200 prompts across 8 categories.

**Selection criteria (in order of priority):**
1. Most universally applicable — works for any business type, not niche industries
2. Easiest to use without prior marketing knowledge — simpler variables, clearer expected output
3. Highest immediate ROI — prompts for high-leverage tasks (Facebook ad, email subject line, landing page headline) over niche tasks (LinkedIn InMail cold outreach to CISO decision-makers)
4. Variety within category — do not select 25 Facebook ads; select across sub-topics within the category

**What Starter does NOT include (per product decision):**
- Notion templates — Starter is prompts-only; Notion templates are the upsell to Full Kit
- Advanced/niche prompts — keep the most approachable 25 per category

**File structure:** Same format as Full Kit, same category order. Add a header note:

```
# AI Marketing Prompt Kit — Starter (200 Prompts)

> **This is the Starter tier.** The Full Kit includes 500+ prompts plus four Notion templates
> (30-Day Content Calendar, 90-Day Content Calendar, Brand Strategy Workspace, Campaign Planner).
> Upgrade at [URL to be added].

## How to Use This Pack
[Same guidance as Full Kit, same 3 paragraphs]

## Table of Contents
[8 categories, 25 prompts each]
```

Each category section must show exactly 25 prompts in the same three-field format. Do NOT modify the prompt content from the Full Kit — copy exactly as written; changes here will create inconsistency.
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Count prompt entries
grep -c "^### " downloads/ai-prompt-kit-starter-content.md

# Confirm 8 categories
grep "^## Category" downloads/ai-prompt-kit-starter-content.md

# Confirm structural consistency
grep -c "^\*\*CONTEXT:\*\*" downloads/ai-prompt-kit-starter-content.md
grep -c "^\*\*EXPECTED OUTPUT:\*\*" downloads/ai-prompt-kit-starter-content.md
```
Prompt count must be exactly 200. Both field counts must equal 200.
  </verify>
  <done>
File exists at `downloads/ai-prompt-kit-starter-content.md` with:
- Exactly 200 prompt entries
- Exactly 25 per category
- All prompts copied verbatim from Full Kit (no modifications)
- Starter-tier header note present with upgrade mention
- All four structural fields present on every prompt
  </done>

After both tasks complete:
1. `grep -c "^### " downloads/ai-prompt-kit-full-content.md` returns >= 500
2. `grep -c "^### " downloads/ai-prompt-kit-starter-content.md` returns exactly 200
3. All 8 category headers appear in both files
4. CONTEXT/PROMPT/VARIABLES/EXPECTED OUTPUT counts match prompt counts in each file
5. Open both files and manually read 5 random prompts from different categories — each must be specific enough to use immediately without guessing what to fill in
