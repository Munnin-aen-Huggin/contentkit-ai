<objective>
Configure the complete 5-email nurture sequence in Kit with proper delays and publish all emails.

Purpose: The nurture sequence is the core revenue driver -- it takes a free lead magnet subscriber and guides them toward a purchase over 9 days. Without this sequence, leads opt in and never hear from the business again.

Output: A fully configured, published, and activated 5-email sequence in Kit that auto-sends to every new subscriber.

  <name>Task 1: Add emails 2-5 to the lead-magnet-delivery sequence in Kit</name>
  <action>
Open the nurture email copy reference file at `downloads/nurture-email-copy.md` (created in Plan 03-01). Paste each email into the Kit sequence editor.

**Step-by-step instructions:**

1. Go to Kit Dashboard → Send → Sequences → click "lead-magnet-delivery"
2. Email 1 (Day 0) should already exist from Plan 03-01. Verify its content matches the lead magnet delivery email in asset-manifest.md.

3. **Add Email 2 (Day 2: Value/Credibility)**
   - Click "Add Email Step" after Email 1
   - Set delay: 2 days after previous email
   - Paste subject line from nurture-email-copy.md Email 2
   - Paste body from nurture-email-copy.md Email 2
   - Click "Publish" on this email

4. **Add Email 3 (Day 4: Product Introduction)**
   - Click "Add Email Step" after Email 2
   - Set delay: 2 days after previous email
   - Paste subject line from nurture-email-copy.md Email 3
   - Paste body from nurture-email-copy.md Email 3
   - VERIFY: Both checkout URLs are correct:
     - Starter ($27): https://contentkit-ai.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/buy/91776603-aff0-4efb-9513-0be0a1514540
     - Full Kit ($47): https://contentkit-ai.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/buy/5a44db7f-e439-4acf-9a90-96073b40fe9a
   - Click "Publish" on this email

5. **Add Email 4 (Day 6: Social Proof/Case Study)**
   - Click "Add Email Step" after Email 3
   - Set delay: 2 days after previous email
   - Paste subject line from nurture-email-copy.md Email 4
   - Paste body from nurture-email-copy.md Email 4
   - VERIFY: Checkout URLs are correct (same as Email 3)
   - Click "Publish" on this email

6. **Add Email 5 (Day 9: Urgency/Final Offer)**
   - Click "Add Email Step" after Email 4
   - Set delay: 3 days after previous email (NOT 2 — this makes it Day 9 total)
   - Paste subject line from nurture-email-copy.md Email 5
   - Paste body from nurture-email-copy.md Email 5
   - VERIFY: Checkout URLs are correct (same as Email 3)
   - Click "Publish" on this email

7. **Activate the full sequence:**
   - Ensure ALL 5 emails show "Published" status (not Draft)
   - Ensure the overall sequence shows "Active" status
   - If any email is in Draft state, click "Publish" on it individually

**PITFALL WARNING (from research):**
- Each email must be individually Published AND the sequence must be Activated — both steps are required
- If the sequence shows "Inactive" badge, subscribers will be enrolled but receive no emails
  </action>
  <resume-signal>Confirm: "All 5 emails published, sequence active" or describe any issues encountered.</resume-signal>
