<objective>
Set up Kit (ConvertKit) email infrastructure, write all nurture email copy, and embed the opt-in form on the landing page.

Purpose: This plan establishes the email capture foundation that the entire funnel depends on. Without a working Kit account, form, tags, and automation, no lead magnet delivery or nurture sequence can function.

Output: Working Kit account with form, 4 tags (including generic "buyer"), 3 visual automations (opt-in + 2 buyer-removal), form embedded on index.html, and complete 5-email nurture copy in a reference file.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write complete 5-email nurture sequence copy</name>
  <files>downloads/nurture-email-copy.md</files>
  <action>
Create `downloads/nurture-email-copy.md` containing the complete email copy for all 5 emails in the lead-magnet-delivery nurture sequence. This file will be the reference document that gets pasted into Kit's sequence editor.

**Email schedule and content (from ROADMAP success criteria 2):**

**Email 1 — Day 0 (immediate): Lead Magnet Delivery**
- Subject: "Here are your 5 AI copywriting prompts [download inside]"
- Body: Use the template from `downloads/asset-manifest.md` (Sequence: lead-magnet-delivery, Email 1). Include the PDF download link: https://getcontentkit.com/downloads/5-ai-prompts-lead-magnet.pdf
- Use {{subscriber.first_name}} for Kit merge tag personalization
- Sign off as "ContentKit AI"

**Email 2 — Day 2: Value/Credibility**
- Subject: Something establishing authority — e.g., "The AI copy mistake 90% of marketers make"
- Body: Deliver genuine value about getting better results from AI prompts. Share a specific tip or insight about prompt engineering for marketing. No hard sell — build trust. Soft mention of ContentKit at the end.
- ~150-250 words

**Email 3 — Day 4: Product Introduction**
- Subject: Something introducing the full product — e.g., "I built something for marketers who hate staring at blank screens"
- Body: Introduce the ContentKit AI prompt pack naturally. Explain what it is (500+ prompts across 8 categories), who it's for, and how it differs from generic AI prompting. Include the Starter checkout URL: https://contentkit-ai.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/buy/91776603-aff0-4efb-9513-0be0a1514540 and Full Kit checkout URL: https://contentkit-ai.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/buy/5a44db7f-e439-4acf-9a90-96073b40fe9a
- ~200-300 words

**Email 4 — Day 6: Social Proof/Case Study**
- Subject: Something proof-based — e.g., "How one freelancer cut their content time by 70%"
- Body: Use a fictional but realistic case study showing transformation. Include specific before/after metrics. Reference the product with checkout links.
- ~200-300 words

**Email 5 — Day 9: Urgency/Final Offer**
- Subject: Something creating urgency — e.g., "Last chance: Your AI marketing toolkit is waiting"
- Body: Final push with scarcity/urgency framing. Recap the value proposition. Both checkout URLs included prominently. This is the hardest sell in the sequence.
- ~200-300 words

**Format requirements:**
- Each email clearly separated with markdown headers
- Subject line on its own line
- Body copy using Kit merge tags ({{subscriber.first_name}})
- All URLs are real, production URLs (not placeholders)
- Day number and send delay clearly marked for each email
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at downloads/nurture-email-copy.md. Contains 5 clearly separated emails. Each email has: subject line, body with {{subscriber.first_name}} merge tag, appropriate checkout URLs in emails 3-5, lead magnet URL in email 1.
  </verify>
  <done>
All 5 nurture emails exist with complete copy, correct URLs, and Kit merge tags — ready to paste into Kit sequence editor.

  <name>Task 2: Create Kit account, form, tags, and automation</name>
  <action>
The user must complete these steps in the Kit web dashboard. Claude cannot automate Kit account creation or UI configuration.

**Step-by-step instructions:**

**A. Create Kit Account**
1. Go to https://kit.com and sign up for a new account
2. IMPORTANT: The free Newsletter plan only allows 1 sequence and 1 automation. The phase requires 3 sequences minimum.
3. RECOMMENDATION: Upgrade to Kit Creator plan ($33/month) for unlimited sequences and automations. Two sales ($27 + $47 = $74) cover the monthly cost.
4. If staying on free plan: Only the lead-magnet-delivery sequence will work. Post-purchase sequences must be deferred.

**B. Create 4 Tags**
1. Go to Kit Dashboard → Grow → Subscribers → Tags tab
2. Create tag: `lead-magnet-subscriber`
3. Create tag: `purchased-starter`
4. Create tag: `purchased-full-kit`
5. Create tag: `buyer`

**C. Create Opt-In Form**
1. Go to Kit Dashboard → Grow → Landing Pages & Forms
2. Click "Create New" → Form → Inline form
3. Configure: Email field (required), First Name field (optional)
4. Button text: "Get the Free Guide" or "Download Free Prompts"
5. After-subscribe action: Show success message (e.g., "Check your inbox! Your guide is on the way.")
6. Save the form

**D. Create Lead-Magnet-Delivery Sequence**
1. Go to Kit Dashboard → Send → Sequences
2. Create new sequence: "lead-magnet-delivery"
3. For now, just create the sequence shell with Email 1 (the lead magnet delivery email from downloads/asset-manifest.md). The remaining 4 emails will be added in Plan 03-02.
4. Set Email 1 delay: Send immediately (0 days)
5. Publish Email 1 and activate the sequence

**E. Create Visual Automation (opt-in → tag + sequence)**
1. Go to Kit Dashboard → Automate → Visual Automations
2. Create new automation
3. Trigger: "Subscribes to a form" → select the form from step C
4. Action 1: "Add tag" → select `lead-magnet-subscriber`
5. Action 2: "Add to email sequence" → select `lead-magnet-delivery`
6. Activate the automation

**E2. Create Visual Automation (buyer → remove from lead sequence)**
This automation ensures buyers stop receiving the nurture/sales emails, keeping lead and buyer segments non-overlapping (ROADMAP SC-5).
1. Go to Kit Dashboard → Automate → Visual Automations → New Automation
2. Trigger: "Tag is added" → select `purchased-starter`
3. Action: "Remove from email sequence" → select `lead-magnet-delivery`
4. Activate the automation
5. Create a SECOND automation with the same structure but trigger on `purchased-full-kit` tag
   (Kit visual automations support one trigger each, so you need two automations)
6. Verify both automations are Active

**F. Record Form ID**
1. Go to the form you created → Settings → Embed
2. Copy the Form ID (the number in the form action URL)
3. Also note the form UID (the `data-uid` value)
4. Report these values when resuming:
   - Form ID: ___
   - Form UID: ___
  </action>
  <resume-signal>Provide: Kit plan (free or Creator), Form ID, Form UID, and confirm all 4 tags + 3 automations (opt-in, buyer-removal x2) are created. Example: "Creator plan. Form ID: 7654321. UID: abc123def. 4 tags and 3 automations done."</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Embed Kit opt-in form on landing page</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
After receiving the Kit Form ID and UID from Task 2, embed the Kit opt-in form on the landing page.

**Implementation approach — plain HTML form (no JavaScript dependency):**

Use the plain HTML form pattern from research. This works reliably on static GitHub Pages sites:

```html
<form action="https://app.convertkit.com/forms/{FORM_ID}/subscriptions"
      method="post"
      class="[Tailwind classes for styling]">
  <input name="email_address" type="email" placeholder="Your best email" required
         class="[Tailwind input styling]" />
  <button type="submit"
          class="[Tailwind button styling]">
    Get the Free Guide
  </button>
</form>
```

**Where to place the form in index.html:**

1. Add a lead magnet opt-in section ABOVE the pricing section. This section should have:
   - A compelling headline: "Get 5 Free AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"
   - A brief description of what they'll receive
   - The Kit form (email input + submit button)
   - A trust note: "Free instant download. No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."

2. Style with existing Tailwind theme (bg-dark-800 or bg-dark-900 with brand-500 accents)

3. Replace `{FORM_ID}` with the actual Form ID provided by the user in Task 2

**Important:**
- Do NOT use the Kit JavaScript embed (ck.5.js) — the plain HTML form works on static sites and avoids external JS dependency
- The form action URL format is: `https://app.convertkit.com/forms/{FORM_ID}/subscriptions`
- Kit will handle the redirect/success message after submission
  </action>
  <verify>
Open index.html in browser. The lead magnet opt-in section is visible with an email input field and submit button. The form action URL contains the correct Kit form ID. The section is styled consistently with the rest of the page.
  </verify>
  <done>
Kit opt-in form is embedded on the landing page with proper form action URL, styled consistently with the page design, and positioned above the pricing section.
  </done>
</task>
