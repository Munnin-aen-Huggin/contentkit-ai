<objective>
Create two Stripe Payment Links in the Stripe Dashboard — $27 Starter Kit and $47 Full Kit — each configured to redirect to the thank-you.html page on Cloudflare Pages after purchase.

Purpose: Payment Links are the purchase mechanism. Phase 4 (sales page) embeds these URLs in "Buy Now" buttons. The Cloudflare Pages URL from Plan 02-02 is required before this plan can run — it is the redirect URL.
Output: Two live buy.stripe.com/... URLs documented in the plan summary for Phase 4.

<tasks>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Create Stripe Payment Link — $27 Starter Kit</name>
  <action>
Human action required — Claude cannot authenticate to the Stripe Dashboard.

Before starting: Get the Cloudflare Pages URL from 02-02-SUMMARY.md (e.g., `https://contentkit-ai.pages.dev`). The redirect URL will be `https://YOUR-PAGES-URL/thank-you.html`.

CRITICAL — Live mode check: Confirm the Stripe Dashboard toggle (top-left, next to "Stripe") reads "Live" not "Test". Payment links created in test mode have a `test_` prefix in the URL and cannot receive real payments.

Steps:
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links
2. Click + New (top right)
3. Click + Add a new product
4. Fill in product details:
   - Name: ContentKit AI — Starter Kit
   - Price: $27.00
   - Billing period: One-time
5. Click Add product to confirm
6. Click the "After the payment" tab (near the top of the form)
7. Under "Confirmation page", select "Don't show confirmation page"
8. In the redirect URL field, enter: https://YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-PAGES-URL/thank-you.html
   (Replace with the actual URL from 02-02-SUMMARY.md)
9. Click Create link
10. On the next screen, copy the full Payment Link URL (starts with https://buy.stripe.com/...)
  </action>
  <verify>The Payment Link URL does NOT contain `test_`. The Stripe Dashboard shows the link in Payment Links list with price $27.00 and product name "ContentKit AI — Starter Kit".</verify>
  <done>A live Stripe Payment Link exists for $27 Starter Kit with redirect to thank-you.html. URL format is https://buy.stripe.com/... (no test_ prefix).</done>
  <resume-signal>Paste the $27 Starter Kit Payment Link URL here (e.g., "https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxxxxxx") to continue.</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Create Stripe Payment Link — $47 Full Kit</name>
  <action>
Human action required — Claude cannot authenticate to the Stripe Dashboard.

Create the second Stripe Payment Link for the Full Kit product. Same process as Task 1.

Steps:
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links
2. Click + New
3. Click + Add a new product
4. Fill in product details:
   - Name: ContentKit AI — Full Kit
   - Price: $47.00
   - Billing period: One-time
5. Click Add product
6. Click the "After the payment" tab
7. Under "Confirmation page", select "Don't show confirmation page"
8. In the redirect URL field, enter the same thank-you URL: https://YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-PAGES-URL/thank-you.html
9. Click Create link
10. Copy the full Payment Link URL

Note: You can add `?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` to the redirect URL if you want to correlate Stripe sessions with webhook events in Phase 3. For now, the plain URL is fine — it can be edited in the Stripe Dashboard at any time.
  </action>
  <verify>The Payment Link URL does NOT contain `test_`. The Stripe Dashboard shows the link in Payment Links list with price $47.00 and product name "ContentKit AI — Full Kit".</verify>
  <done>A live Stripe Payment Link exists for $47 Full Kit with redirect to thank-you.html. URL format is https://buy.stripe.com/... (no test_ prefix, different URL from Starter Kit link).</done>
  <resume-signal>Paste the $47 Full Kit Payment Link URL here (e.g., "https://buy.stripe.com/yyyyyyyyy") to continue.</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Verify both Payment Links and document URLs</name>
  <action>
Verify both Stripe Payment Links in the dashboard and confirm the thank-you.html stub resolves on the live Cloudflare Pages domain.

Steps to verify:
1. In Stripe Dashboard → Payment Links, confirm both links appear with correct prices
2. Click into each link and verify:
   - Price matches ($27 and $47 respectively)
   - After-payment redirect URL is set to the correct thank-you.html URL
   - The URL shown does NOT contain `test_`
3. Verify the redirect target resolves: visit https://YOUR-PAGES-URL/thank-you.html in a browser — should show the "Thank you for your purchase!" stub page (not a 404)
4. Optionally click "Preview" on each Stripe link to see the hosted checkout page (no payment needed)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Stripe Dashboard shows two Payment Links: $27 Starter and $47 Full Kit, both in live mode
2. https://YOUR-PAGES-URL/thank-you.html resolves and shows the stub page (not 404)
3. Both buy.stripe.com/... URLs are recorded and do not contain `test_`
  </verify>
  <done>Two live Stripe Payment Links confirmed in Stripe Dashboard. thank-you.html resolves on Cloudflare Pages domain. Both Payment Link URLs documented in the summary for Phase 4 use.</done>
  <resume-signal>Type "verified" when both Payment Links are confirmed, and include both URLs in your response so they are captured in the summary.</resume-signal>
</task>

Final Phase 2 infrastructure check:

1. Tailwind build works: `./tailwindcss --input src/input.css --output output.css --minify` runs without error
2. Alpine.js present: index.html contains `script defer` tag pointing to alpinejs v3.15.8 on jsDelivr
3. Cloudflare Pages live: *.pages.dev URL returns HTTP 200, serves ContentKit AI page
4. Push-to-deploy verified: A commit push triggers automatic redeploy in Cloudflare dashboard
5. Stripe $27 Payment Link: Exists in live mode with thank-you.html redirect
6. Stripe $47 Payment Link: Exists in live mode with thank-you.html redirect
7. thank-you.html resolves: https://YOUR-PAGES-URL/thank-you.html returns the stub page (not 404)

Record both Stripe Payment Link URLs in the summary — Phase 4 requires them.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Two Stripe Payment Links exist in live mode ($27 Starter, $47 Full Kit)
- Each link redirects to the Cloudflare Pages thank-you.html URL after purchase
- Both buy.stripe.com/... URLs are documented in the phase summary
- thank-you.html resolves on the live Cloudflare Pages domain
- Phase 2 all success criteria met (from ROADMAP.md):
  1. Push-to-deploy pipeline working
  2. Two Stripe Payment Links with correct redirect URLs
  3. Tailwind CSS v4 CLI compiles locally
  4. Alpine.js v3 in HTML
  5. Cloudflare Pages URL resolves without errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `/Users/wilfredshammah/Desktop/dp/.planning/phases/02-infrastructure/02-03-SUMMARY.md`

MUST include in the summary:
- Cloudflare Pages URL (*.pages.dev)
- Stripe Payment Link URL for $27 Starter Kit
- Stripe Payment Link URL for $47 Full Kit

Phase 4 (sales page) requires all three URLs.
</output>
