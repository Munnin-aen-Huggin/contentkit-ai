## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: Static HTML + Tailwind CDN over Next.js/React — zero build step, instant deploy
- [Pre-phase]: Stripe Payment Links over Gumroad — 2.9% vs 10% fee
- [Pre-phase]: Cloudflare Pages over Netlify/Vercel — unlimited bandwidth, commercial use permitted on free tier
- [Pre-phase]: Kit (ConvertKit) for email — 10K subscriber free tier (verify current limit at kit.com/pricing before first email)
- [Pre-phase]: Zapier/Make for Stripe webhook → Kit delivery — Cloudflare Worker is alternative; decide during Phase 2 planning
- [Pre-phase]: EU VAT decision deferred — must resolve before first sale (Stripe Payment Links vs. Lemon Squeezy merchant of record)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Verify Zapier template availability for Stripe checkout.session.completed → Kit add subscriber with buyer tag before committing to Zapier over Cloudflare Worker
- [Phase 2]: EU VAT handling — explicit decision required before first sale; cannot be deferred after revenue begins
- [Phase 1]: Social proof dependency — testimonials from 10-20 beta users are a hard dependency for PAGE-05; collect during Phase 1 before Phase 4 begins
