## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v1.1 decisions:
- Build order: Phase 6 (tracking IDs + pages) → Phase 7 (email) → Phase 8 (ads) → Phase 9 (verify). Running campaigns with placeholder IDs wastes budget; email automation must be live before ad traffic volume increases.
- Kit Creator plan ($39/mo) deferred until Phase 7 win-back sequence is ready to build — do not upgrade preemptively.
- Manual CPC bidding locked for Phase 8 — Smart Bidding requires 30+ conversions/month, stalls new accounts.
- Meta business verification required before any campaign creation in Phase 8.

### Pending Todos

- Real charge end-to-end test ($147 Starter → refund) — scheduled for Phase 9
- Mobile device physical test — scheduled for Phase 9
- Email deliverability verification (Gmail + Outlook) — scheduled for Phase 9
- Production link audit
- Replace ad tracking placeholder IDs — Phase 6 task
- Create 8 Google Docs from free-resource.md files (see marketing/reddit/google-doc-links.md)
- Execute Reddit Batch 1 seeding: r/freelance, r/smallbusiness, r/marketing, r/entrepreneur
- Start Twitter/X 30-day calendar posting
- Execute Product Hunt launch after Reddit/Twitter establish initial traction
- Set up ConvertKit automation rules for reddit-welcome-variant and producthunt-welcome-variant sequences

### Blockers/Concerns

- Kit free plan automation limit (1 visual automation + 1 sequence) needs verification at kit.com/pricing before Phase 7 planning. If stricter than reported, Creator plan upgrade moves earlier.
- Kit "cold subscriber" filter may be fixed at 90 days (not configurable). If confirmed, Phase 7 win-back needs manual tag-based workaround. Verify in live Kit dashboard before designing Phase 7 automation.
- Meta Ads account restriction risk: complete business verification before any campaign creation in Phase 8.
