# Organic Marketing Playbook — ContentKit AI

## Reddit Subreddit Infiltration Strategy

**Goal**: Generate passive sales from high-traffic subreddits without getting banned.

### Target Subreddits (100K+ members)

| Subreddit | Members | Angle |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| r/freelance | 800K | AI prompts for client deliverables |
| r/realtors | 200K | Marketing templates for agents |
| r/accounting | 400K | Content systems to reduce admin |
| r/sales | 300K | Email/ad scripts that convert |
| r/marketing | Large | Direct target audience |
| r/smallbusiness | Large | Solopreneur toolkit |
| r/Entrepreneur | Large | Productivity/scaling angle |
| r/copywriting | Medium | Professional tool upgrade |

### The 5-Step Posting Sequence

**Step 1: Seed Phase (Days 1–7)**
- Post 3 value comments per day in the target subreddit
- Answer questions genuinely — no promotion whatsoever
- Build karma and trust within the specific community
- Focus on threads where marketing/content pain points surface

**Step 2: Resource Post (Day 8)**
- Title format: "I made a free [template/checklist/guide] for [specific problem]"
- Link to a Google Doc — genuinely free, genuinely valuable
- Examples:
  - "I made a free 30-day content calendar for freelancers who hate posting"
  - "Free email template pack I built for real estate agents — 10 sequences"
  - "I compiled 20 AI prompts that actually produce usable ad copy — free doc"
- Mods approve because it's free and helpful

**Step 3: The Soft Upsell**
- The Google Doc contains real value (a subset of ContentKit prompts)
- One line at the bottom: "I also made a more complete version with 500+ prompts across 8 categories — [link]"
- Link goes to: https://getcontentkit.com/ or direct Stripe link
- Price point for Reddit audience: consider a lower-tier entry ($34–67 range) or use existing $197 Starter

**Step 4: Post Compounds**
- Reddit posts rank on Google
- "Free resource" post appears in search results for "[profession] + [problem]"
- Generates passive traffic for months/years
- One post can drive 4–6 sales/day indefinitely

**Step 5: Scale Across Subreddits**
- Repeat the sequence in each target subreddit
- Use different Google Docs tailored to each audience
- Each subreddit gets a custom angle that speaks to their specific pain

### Key Rules
- The free content MUST be genuinely useful — this is what keeps the post up
- Never "sell" in the subreddit — you're "sharing a resource"
- Customize the free doc for each subreddit's audience
- Don't cross-post — each subreddit gets unique engagement
- Build karma organically before the resource post
- One subreddit at a time — don't rush

### Content Assets Needed
- [ ] Google Doc: Free prompt pack for freelancers (subset of ContentKit)
- [ ] Google Doc: Free email templates for real estate agents
- [ ] Google Doc: Free ad copy prompts for small business owners
- [ ] Google Doc: Free sales scripts/email sequences for salespeople
- [ ] Landing page or direct Stripe link optimized for Reddit traffic
