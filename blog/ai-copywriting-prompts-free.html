      <div class="article-content">

        <p>A professional copywriter charges $3,000-$5,000 for a single sales page rewrite. An email sequence with five emails runs another $1,500-$3,000. A full launch package &mdash; ad copy, landing page, email sequence &mdash; can reach $8,000-$12,000. For most small businesses, that math does not work.</p>

        <p>The need is real. Every business requires professional-grade copy across every channel &mdash; ads, emails, landing pages, social media &mdash; but not every business can afford to hire a copywriter for every single asset. So they turn to AI. And the results are usually disappointing. Not because AI cannot write, but because generic prompts produce generic copy that sounds like it was written by a committee of no one in particular.</p>

        <p>If you have been looking for <strong>ai copywriting prompts free</strong> of charge, most of what you have found is probably a list of vague one-liners like "write me a Facebook ad" or "create an email subject line." Those instructions give the AI nothing to work with &mdash; no framework, no audience context, no structural constraints. The output is predictably bland.</p>

        <p>This article gives you 20 free AI copywriting prompts &mdash; the exact templates that produce usable first drafts for the three highest-ROI copy types: ads, emails, and landing pages. Each prompt is engineered with a specific copywriting framework, a role assignment for the AI, and a variable structure you customize for your business. These prompts are built on the same engineering used in <a href="/blog/ai-marketing-prompts.html">ContentKit AI</a>, where one freelancer named Marcus used the system to cut content time by 70% and raise his rates from $800 to $1,400/month per client.</p>

        <h2>The Copywriting Framework That Makes AI Prompts Work</h2>

        <p>The difference between AI copy that reads like a first-year marketing student wrote it and AI copy that sounds like a seasoned direct-response pro comes down to one thing: frameworks. AI without a framework produces freeform text. AI with a framework produces structured, persuasive copy that follows the same patterns professional copywriters have used for decades.</p>

        <p>Every prompt in this article is built on one of four proven copywriting frameworks. You do not need to know copywriting theory to use them &mdash; the prompts tell the AI which framework to follow. But understanding why each one works will help you choose the right prompt for the right task.</p>

        <h3>1. PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Ads and short-form sales copy. Open with the pain your audience feels, amplify the cost of inaction (the emotional, financial, and practical toll of not solving it), and then present your product as the specific, direct solution. PAS works because it meets people where they are &mdash; in the problem &mdash; before asking them to take action.</p>

        <h3>2. AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Landing pages and longer sales copy. Hook attention with a bold headline, build interest with specific details and proof points, create desire by painting the after-state, and drive action with a clear CTA. AIDA is the backbone of most high-converting landing pages because it guides the reader through a logical emotional journey.</p>

        <h3>3. Before-After-Bridge</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Email and social content. Show the current state (before) &mdash; the frustration, the time wasted, the mediocre results. Paint the desired state (after) &mdash; the ease, the speed, the professional output. Then position your product as the bridge between the two. This framework is particularly effective for nurture emails and social posts because it creates a vision the reader can feel before you ever mention your product.</p>

        <h3>4. "What's Inside" Structure</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Launch emails and product announcements. Skip the persuasion. Lead with specifics. Tell the reader exactly what they get &mdash; product components, features, deliverables &mdash; in a clean, bulleted format. This framework works because your warmest audiences (email subscribers, existing customers) already trust you. They do not need to be sold; they need to know what is inside the box.</p>

        <p>Here is a quick reference for matching the right framework to the right task:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>PAS</strong> &rarr; Facebook ads, Google ads, short-form sales copy</li>
          <li><strong>AIDA</strong> &rarr; Landing pages, long-form sales pages, product pages</li>
          <li><strong>Before-After-Bridge</strong> &rarr; Nurture emails, social media posts, retargeting ads</li>
          <li><strong>"What's Inside"</strong> &rarr; Launch emails, product announcements, feature updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Free AI Copywriting Prompts for Ads (5 Prompts)</h2>

        <p>These five prompts cover the most common paid ad formats where businesses spend the most money. Each one is built on a tested framework with role assignments and variable structures that make the AI output actually usable &mdash; not generic filler you throw away.</p>

        <h3>Prompt 1: Facebook Ad &mdash; PAS Framework</h3>

        <p>This is the workhorse of paid social advertising. The PAS framework opens with pain, amplifies the cost of inaction, and closes with your product as the solution. The prompt below produces a complete, ready-to-run Facebook ad with primary text, headline, and description line.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; FB-01: Facebook Ad (PAS Framework)</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a direct-response Facebook ad copywriter who specializes in the Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) framework. Write a complete, ready-to-run Facebook ad for the product below using the PAS structure. Problem: open with a single painful problem your target audience faces &mdash; one sentence, no intro. Agitate: spend 2-3 sentences amplifying the emotional and practical cost of that problem (time lost, money wasted, confidence eroded). Solve: position the product as the specific, direct solution in 2-3 sentences. Close with one clear CTA sentence. Total primary text: 150-200 words. Also write a headline (under 40 characters) and a description line (under 30 characters).<br><br>Product Name: <span class="variable">[PRODUCT NAME]</span><br>Target Audience: <span class="variable">[TARGET AUDIENCE]</span><br>Pain Point: <span class="variable">[PAIN POINT]</span><br>How It Solves It: <span class="variable">[HOW IT SOLVES IT]</span><br>Call to Action: <span class="variable">[CALL TO ACTION]</span></div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Example output</strong> (for Momentum Fitness &mdash; online coaching for desk workers):</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Primary Text:</strong><br>You sit at a desk for 8 hours, come home exhausted, and the last thing you have energy for is a workout. So you skip it. Again. And again. And suddenly three months have gone by and nothing has changed &mdash; except you feel worse about it than you did before.<br><br>The problem isn't your willpower. The problem is you're following fitness programs built for people with gyms, free time, and 20-year-old bodies. None of those programs account for a back that aches from a chair, a schedule that leaves you 30 minutes on a good day, or a brain that's already spent by 6pm.<br><br>Momentum Fitness was built specifically for desk workers. 30-minute home workouts, no equipment, no commute. Programs designed around the exact limitations that make every other routine fail for people like you.<br><br>Start your free 7-day trial &mdash; no credit card required.<br><br><strong>Headline:</strong> Built for desk workers.<br><strong>Description:</strong> No gym. 30 mins. Real results.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>A direct-response copywriter would charge $300-$600 and take several hours to research your audience and write a tested PAS Facebook ad. This prompt produces a strong first draft in under 3 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Prompt 2: Facebook Ad &mdash; Social Proof Angle</h3>

        <p>Social proof ads lead with a specific customer result or statistic instead of a pain point. They work because they replace claims with evidence. This prompt produces a 100-150 word primary text plus a headline that references the proof point.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; FB-05: Facebook Ad (Social Proof)</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a direct-response Facebook ad copywriter who specializes in social proof-driven ad copy. Write a Facebook ad that leads with a specific customer result or statistic. Open with the result in the first sentence &mdash; make it concrete and quantifiable. Follow with 2-3 sentences that contextualize the result for the target audience. Close with a CTA sentence. Total primary text: 100-150 words. Headline: under 40 characters, referencing the proof point. Description: under 30 characters.<br><br>Product Name: <span class="variable">[PRODUCT NAME]</span><br>Customer Result: <span class="variable">[CUSTOMER RESULT]</span><br>Target Audience: <span class="variable">[TARGET AUDIENCE]</span><br>Call to Action: <span class="variable">[CTA]</span></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Prompt 3: Instagram Story Ad with Urgency</h3>

        <p>Story ads demand extreme brevity &mdash; you have three lines to hook, deliver value, and drive action. This prompt produces a 3-line format optimized for vertical story placement with built-in urgency.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; IG-04: Instagram Story Ad (Urgency)</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a social media advertiser who specializes in Instagram Story ad placements. Write a 3-line Instagram Story ad with a hook, value statement, and CTA. Format: Line 1 = attention hook (bold claim or question), Line 2 = value statement with urgency element, Line 3 = CTA with link text. Total: under 60 words. Tone: direct, conversational, urgent without being desperate.<br><br>Offer: <span class="variable">[OFFER]</span><br>Deadline: <span class="variable">[DEADLINE]</span><br>CTA Link Text: <span class="variable">[CTA LINK TEXT]</span></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Prompt 4: Google Search Ad Headlines</h3>

        <p>Google ads live and die by headlines. This prompt generates 15 headline variations under 30 characters each, organized by angle &mdash; benefit, urgency, social proof, question, and direct &mdash; so you can test systematically instead of guessing.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; AD-09: Google Search Ad Headlines</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a PPC specialist who writes Google Search ad headlines for high-intent keywords. Generate 15 headline variations for the product below. Each headline must be under 30 characters. Organize into 5 groups of 3: (1) Benefit-driven, (2) Urgency-driven, (3) Social proof, (4) Question-based, (5) Direct/descriptive. No exclamation marks. No clickbait.<br><br>Target Keyword: <span class="variable">[KEYWORD]</span><br>Product Name: <span class="variable">[PRODUCT NAME]</span><br>Unique Selling Point: <span class="variable">[UNIQUE SELLING POINT]</span></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Prompt 5: LinkedIn Sponsored Content</h3>

        <p>LinkedIn ads require a professional tone and a value-proposition framework that speaks to decision-makers. This prompt produces B2B ad copy with 150 words of primary text, a headline, and a CTA tailored for the LinkedIn feed.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; AD-15: LinkedIn Sponsored Content</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a B2B advertiser who writes LinkedIn Sponsored Content for SaaS and professional service companies. Write a LinkedIn feed ad using a value-proposition framework. Open with a specific challenge the target role faces (1-2 sentences). Present the product as the solution with one concrete metric or result (2-3 sentences). Close with a professional CTA. Total primary text: 150 words. Headline: under 50 characters. Tone: professional, not corporate. No jargon.<br><br>Product/Service: <span class="variable">[PRODUCT/SERVICE]</span><br>Target Role/Industry: <span class="variable">[TARGET ROLE/INDUSTRY]</span><br>Key Metric/Result: <span class="variable">[KEY METRIC/RESULT]</span><br>Call to Action: <span class="variable">[CTA]</span></div>

        <h2>Free AI Copywriting Prompts for Emails (8 Prompts)</h2>

        <p>Email requires more prompt variety than any other channel because there are distinct email types &mdash; each with different goals, tones, and structures. A welcome email sounds nothing like a cold outreach email. A launch announcement serves a completely different purpose than a re-engagement sequence. These eight prompts cover the email types that drive the most revenue.</p>

        <h3>Prompt 6: Email Subject Line Generator (10 Angles)</h3>

        <p>Subject lines determine whether your email gets opened or ignored. This prompt generates 10 subject line variations using 10 different copywriting angles &mdash; so you can A/B test with purpose instead of guessing. Every subject line stays under 50 characters for maximum mobile visibility.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; EM-03: Email Subject Line Generator</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as an email marketing strategist with 10 years of experience writing subject lines for high-converting promotional campaigns. Generate 10 email subject line variations for the promotional email described below. Use a DIFFERENT copywriting angle for each subject line, drawing from this list: (1) Curiosity Gap, (2) Urgency/Scarcity, (3) Social Proof, (4) Benefit-Led, (5) Personalization Hook, (6) Direct Question, (7) "How To", (8) Numbered List, (9) Fear of Missing Out, (10) Humor/Unexpected Angle. Label each with its angle. Keep all subject lines under 50 characters.<br><br>Offer Description: <span class="variable">[OFFER DESCRIPTION]</span><br>Target Audience: <span class="variable">[TARGET AUDIENCE]</span><br>Email Goal: <span class="variable">[EMAIL GOAL]</span></div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Example output</strong> (for a Black Friday sale on an online business growth course):</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>1. <strong>(Curiosity Gap)</strong> The price drops at midnight. Here's why.<br>
          2. <strong>(Urgency/Scarcity)</strong> 9 hours left &mdash; then it's gone<br>
          3. <strong>(Social Proof)</strong> 847 people grabbed this. You haven't yet.<br>
          4. <strong>(Benefit-Led)</strong> Add $1K/mo in 30 days &mdash; or your money back<br>
          5. <strong>(Personalization Hook)</strong> This is for you (if you're not at $5K/mo yet)<br>
          6. <strong>(Direct Question)</strong> Ready to stop leaving money on the table?<br>
          7. <strong>(How To)</strong> How to add a revenue stream before December ends<br>

          9. <strong>(Fear of Missing Out)</strong> Your competitors are using this. You're not.<br>
          10. <strong>(Humor/Unexpected)</strong> This email is basically begging you to save money</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>An email marketing strategist would charge $150-$300 and spend a full afternoon building a subject line test set. This prompt produces 10 testable options in 3 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Prompt 7: Product Launch Email</h3>

        <p>Launch emails are the highest-revenue single emails most businesses send. This prompt uses the "What's Inside" structure &mdash; no hype, just specifics about what the buyer gets. It works because your email list already knows you; they need information, not persuasion.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; EM-16: Product Launch Email</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a product launch email copywriter. Write a launch day email for the product below, sent to an existing email list of warm subscribers who know the sender.

Follow with a brief urgency block (1-2 sentences &mdash; limited time, limited bonus, or early-bird price). Close with a single CTA line. Sign-off should be personal and brief. Total length: 200-300 words.

        </blockquote>

        <h3>Prompt 8: Welcome Email for New Subscribers</h3>

        <p>The welcome email sets the tone for your entire relationship with a subscriber. It has the highest open rate of any email you will ever send. This prompt produces a warm, expectation-setting email with a single CTA to a next step.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; EM-01: Welcome Email</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as an email copywriter who specializes in welcome sequences for digital brands. Write a welcome email for a new subscriber. Structure: (1) warm acknowledgment of the signup, (2) set expectations for email frequency and content type, (3) deliver one immediate value item (the lead magnet or a quick tip), (4) single CTA to a next step (not a sale). Tone: friendly, direct, not overly enthusiastic.

        </div>

        <h3>Prompt 9: Nurture Email &mdash; Value/Credibility</h3>

        <p>Nurture emails build trust between the welcome and the sale. This prompt uses a teach-one-concept structure with a concrete before/after example &mdash; the same approach used in ContentKit's own email sequence, where the Day 2 email ("The AI copy mistake 90% of marketers make") teaches the difference between generic prompts and structured prompts with a side-by-side comparison.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">

        <h3>Prompt 10: Abandoned Cart Recovery Email</h3>

        <p>Cart abandonment emails recover revenue that is already 90% of the way to a sale. The key is to address the most likely objection directly &mdash; not just remind them they left something behind.</p>

        <h2>Free AI Copywriting Prompts for Landing Pages (7 Prompts)</h2>

        <p>Landing page copy is the most complex type of copywriting because a single page has multiple sections, each with a distinct job. The hero section hooks attention. The benefits section builds desire. The social proof section eliminates doubt. The FAQ section handles objections. The CTA section drives action. These seven prompts cover the full page from top to bottom, so you can build a complete landing page without hiring a conversion copywriter.</p>

        <h3>Prompt 14: Hero Section</h3>

        <p>The hero section is the single most valuable piece of copy on any landing page. It determines whether a visitor stays or bounces within 3 seconds. This prompt produces a headline, subheadline, three benefit bullets, and a CTA button &mdash; all optimized for cold traffic conversion.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; LP-01: Landing Page Hero Section</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a conversion copywriter who specializes in landing page optimization. Write a hero section for the landing page described below. The hero section must include: (1) a primary headline &mdash; one sentence, outcome-focused, under 12 words; (2) a subheadline &mdash; one to two sentences that clarify who this is for and what makes it different, under 30 words; (3) three benefit bullets &mdash; each one starting with a bolded micro-benefit (3-4 words), followed by a single explanatory sentence; (4) a CTA button label &mdash; action-oriented, under 5 words. Do NOT use the product name as the headline. Lead with transformation, not identity.<br><br>Product Name: <span class="variable">[PRODUCT NAME]</span><br>Who It's For: <span class="variable">[WHO IT'S FOR]</span><br>Main Outcome: <span class="variable">[MAIN OUTCOME]</span><br>Time to Result: <span class="variable">[TIME TO RESULT]</span><br>Unique Mechanism: <span class="variable">[UNIQUE MECHANISM]</span></div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Example output</strong> (for ProposalKit &mdash; freelance proposal template pack):</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Headline:</strong> Land higher-paying clients with proposals that close.<br><br><strong>Subheadline:</strong> ProposalKit gives freelancers agency-quality proposal templates with pre-written copy &mdash; so you stop losing deals to competitors who simply look more professional.<br><br><strong>Benefit Bullets:</strong><br>&bull; <strong>Send in 20 minutes.</strong> Every template is pre-structured and pre-written &mdash; fill in your numbers, swap in your name, send. No more staring at a blank document.<br>&bull; <strong>Pre-written value language.</strong> The hardest part of a proposal is positioning your price. ProposalKit includes proven value-framing copy so clients understand what they're paying for.<br>&bull; <strong>Built on real agency formats.</strong> Every template is modeled on the proposal structures used by six-figure freelancers &mdash; not generic business document layouts.<br><br><strong>CTA Button:</strong> Get ProposalKit Now</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>A conversion copywriter would charge $400-$700 and take a full day to research your offer and write a hero section built for cold traffic. This prompt produces a strong first draft in 3 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Prompt 15: Feature-to-Benefit Bullet Translator</h3>

        <p>Most businesses list features when they should be selling benefits. This prompt takes a raw list of product features and converts each one into a benefit-driven bullet &mdash; bolded benefit headline plus an explanatory sentence.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; LP-08: Feature-to-Benefit Translator</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a conversion copywriter. Take the list of product features below and convert each one into a benefit-driven bullet point. Format: bolded benefit headline (3-5 words that describe the outcome for the user), followed by one explanatory sentence that connects the feature to that outcome. Do not list the feature as a feature &mdash; translate it entirely into what it means for the buyer.<br><br>Feature List: <span class="variable">[FEATURE LIST]</span><br>Target Audience: <span class="variable">[TARGET AUDIENCE]</span></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Prompt 16: Social Proof / Testimonial Section</h3>

        <p>Testimonials are the most powerful conversion element on a landing page, but most businesses display them poorly. This prompt generates a complete testimonial section layout with a headline and three formatted testimonial placeholders &mdash; plus the exact questions you should send to real customers to get usable quotes.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; LP-10: Social Proof Section</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a landing page copywriter who specializes in social proof sections. Generate a testimonial section for the landing page described below. Include: (1) a section headline that frames the testimonials (not "What Our Customers Say" &mdash; something more specific), (2) three testimonial placeholder slots, each with a prompting question you would send to a real customer to elicit a usable quote, (3) formatting guidance for displaying each testimonial (name, role, company, photo, star rating). The goal is to create a section template AND the customer outreach questions in one prompt.<br><br>Product Name: <span class="variable">[PRODUCT NAME]</span><br>Customer Type: <span class="variable">[CUSTOMER TYPE]</span></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Prompt 17: Pricing Section Copy</h3>

        <p>Pricing copy is not just numbers &mdash; it is positioning. This prompt frames each tier with a positioning statement, highlights the recommended option, and uses anchor pricing to make the target tier feel like a clear value.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; LP-11: Pricing Section Copy</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a pricing strategist and conversion copywriter. Write the copy for a pricing section with the tiers described below. For each tier, include: (1) a tier name, (2) a one-sentence positioning statement that tells the reader who this tier is for, (3) a feature list formatted as benefit-driven bullets, (4) a CTA button label. Highlight the recommended tier visually with a "Most Popular" badge and make it the clear default choice through copy framing. Use anchor pricing &mdash; make the recommended tier feel like obvious value compared to the highest and lowest options.<br><br>Tier Names: <span class="variable">[TIER NAMES]</span><br>Prices: <span class="variable">[PRICES]</span><br>Key Features Per Tier: <span class="variable">[KEY FEATURES PER TIER]</span><br>Recommended Tier: <span class="variable">[RECOMMENDED TIER]</span></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Prompt 18: FAQ Section Generator</h3>

        <p>FAQs are objection-handling disguised as helpful content. This prompt generates 8-10 FAQs based on the most common objections for your product type, with each answer written in 2-3 sentences that address the objection directly instead of deflecting.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; LP-15: FAQ Section Generator</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a conversion copywriter who specializes in landing page FAQ sections. Generate 8-10 frequently asked questions for the product described below. Each question should represent a real objection or concern a potential buyer would have. Each answer should be 2-3 sentences that address the objection directly &mdash; not deflect it. Tone: confident, transparent, helpful. Include questions about price, results timeline, technical requirements, refund policy, and comparison to alternatives.<br><br>Product Name: <span class="variable">[PRODUCT NAME]</span><br>Product Type: <span class="variable">[PRODUCT TYPE]</span><br>Price: <span class="variable">[PRICE]</span><br>Guarantee: <span class="variable">[GUARANTEE]</span></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Prompt 19: Final CTA Block</h3>

        <p>The final CTA block is the last chance to convert a visitor who has read the entire page. This prompt produces an urgency-driven closing section with a restated headline, a one-sentence value summary, and CTA button text.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; LP-19: Final CTA Block</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a conversion copywriter. Write a final CTA block for the bottom of a landing page. Structure: (1) a restated headline that reinforces the main outcome &mdash; different phrasing from the hero headline, (2) one sentence that summarizes the core value proposition, (3) an urgency element (limited time, limited availability, or price increase), (4) a CTA button label that is action-oriented and under 5 words. Tone: confident, direct, urgent without being pushy.<br><br>Main Outcome: <span class="variable">[MAIN OUTCOME]</span><br>Urgency Element: <span class="variable">[URGENCY ELEMENT]</span><br>CTA Text: <span class="variable">[CTA TEXT]</span></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Prompt 20: "Who This Is For / Not For" Section</h3>

        <p>This section builds trust through honesty. By telling visitors who the product is NOT for, you signal confidence and help the right buyers self-select. The two-column format &mdash; five qualifying statements and three disqualifying statements &mdash; is one of the highest-converting section types on modern landing pages.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-label">Prompt &mdash; LP-22: "Who This Is For / Not For" Section</div>
          <div class="prompt-text">Act as a conversion copywriter. Write a "Who This Is For / Who This Is NOT For" section for the landing page described below. Format: two columns. Column 1 &mdash; "This is for you if..." with 5 qualifying statements that describe the ideal buyer's situation, mindset, and goals. Column 2 &mdash; "This is NOT for you if..." with 3 disqualifying statements that honestly describe who should not buy. Tone: direct, honest, builds trust through transparency. Each statement should be one sentence.<br><br>Product Name: <span class="variable">[PRODUCT NAME]</span><br>Ideal Customer Traits: <span class="variable">[IDEAL CUSTOMER TRAITS]</span><br>Non-Ideal Traits: <span class="variable">[NON-IDEAL TRAITS]</span></div>

        <h2>How to Customize These Prompts for Your Business</h2>

        <p>Having 20 prompts is useless if you do not know how to make them work for your specific situation. Here is the four-step process for turning any generic AI copywriting prompt into a high-converting asset for your business.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Replace every bracketed variable with your specific details.</strong> The more specific you are, the better the output. "<span style="color: #0ea5e9;">[TARGET AUDIENCE]</span>: freelancers aged 25-40 who charge under $3K per project and want to raise their rates" beats "<span style="color: #0ea5e9;">[TARGET AUDIENCE]</span>: freelancers" every time. Specificity is the single biggest lever you have for improving AI copy output.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Run the prompt, then use a follow-up refinement prompt.</strong> The first output is a starting point, not a finished product. Use refinement instructions like "Rewrite the headline using a curiosity gap angle," "Make the tone 20% more conversational," or "Cut the body copy to under 100 words." Refinement prompts are where good copy becomes great copy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Edit the last 20%.</strong> AI produces the structure and the language patterns. You add brand voice, specific data points, personal anecdotes, and factual accuracy. Think of these prompts as first-draft generators, not finished-copy machines. The human editing layer is what separates AI-assisted copy from AI-generated copy.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Chain prompts across channels.</strong> Use the winning ad angle from Prompt 1 as the <span style="color: #0ea5e9;">[MAIN BENEFIT]</span> variable in Prompt 14 (hero section) and Prompt 7 (launch email). This creates messaging consistency across your ads, landing page, and email sequence &mdash; which is exactly what professional launch campaigns do.</p>

        <p>This is exactly the system Marcus uses for his 8 freelance consulting clients. His workflow: pick the right category, fill in the client variables, generate multiple options, refine the best one. Each deliverable that used to take 3 hours now takes under an hour. That efficiency gain &mdash; a 70% reduction in content production time &mdash; is what allowed him to take on more clients and raise his rates from $800 to $1,400/month per client.</p>

These prompts produce a strong first draft in 3-5 minutes. The trade-off: AI copy requires editing and does not replace strategic thinking. For high-volume, repeatable copy tasks (ads, emails, social), prompts are dramatically more efficient. For one-time, high-stakes projects (brand positioning, flagship sales page), a human copywriter may still be worth the investment.</div>

        <h2>Start Writing Better Copy Today</h2>

        <p>These 20 free AI copywriting prompts cover the three highest-ROI copy types &mdash; ads, emails, and landing pages. Each prompt is built on a proven copywriting framework (PAS, AIDA, Before-After-Bridge, "What's Inside") with role assignments, variable structures, and output constraints that make AI produce usable first drafts instead of generic filler.</p>

        <p>The cost comparison speaks for itself. A professional copywriter charges $3,000-$5,000 for a sales page, $1,500-$3,000 for an email sequence, and $300-$600 for a single Facebook ad. These prompts produce first drafts for all of those in under 30 minutes. They will not replace a world-class copywriter on a high-stakes project, but for the daily, repeatable copy tasks that keep your business running &mdash; ads, emails, social posts, landing page updates &mdash; they are dramatically faster and more cost-effective.</p>

        <p>Marcus, a freelance marketing consultant serving 8 clients, built his entire workflow around structured AI prompts like these. The result: a 70% reduction in content production time, an increase in deliverable quality that let him raise rates from $800 to $1,400/month per client, and the ability to serve more clients without working more hours. The prompts are the same. The difference is having a system.</p>
