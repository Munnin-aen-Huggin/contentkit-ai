## First Comment / Maker Story

Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [Name], the maker of ContentKit AI, and I want to tell you why I built this.

Here's the frustration that started everything: AI writing tools are incredibly powerful, but most marketers use them like a search engine. They type "write me a Facebook ad" and get back something generic, robotic, and unusable. Then they spend 45 minutes rewriting the output -- which defeats the entire purpose of using AI in the first place.

The problem isn't the AI. It's the prompt.

After working with dozens of marketing teams and freelancers, I kept seeing the same pattern. The people getting genuinely good output from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini weren't asking vague questions. They were giving the AI a detailed brief -- a role to play, a framework to follow, audience specifics, tone parameters, and a defined output format.

So I turned that insight into a system.

**ContentKit AI is a library of 500+ copy-paste marketing prompts across 8 categories:**

- Ads (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn) -- 65 prompts
- Emails -- 65 prompts
- Social Media -- 65 prompts
- Landing Pages -- 60 prompts
- SEO -- 60 prompts
- Brand Strategy -- 55 prompts
- Product Launch -- 65 prompts
- Video Scripts -- 65 prompts

Every single prompt is pre-engineered with role assignment, copywriting framework, audience variables, and output format. You fill in your specific details, paste it into any AI tool, and get professional-grade marketing copy in seconds -- not minutes or hours.

It also comes with 4 Notion templates: a 30-day content calendar, a 90-day content calendar, a brand strategy workspace, and a campaign planner.

**Who is this for?** Solopreneurs, freelance marketers, and small marketing teams who need to produce high-quality content across multiple channels without hiring a copywriter or paying for expensive subscriptions.

**Does it actually work?** One early user, Marcus -- a freelance marketing consultant serving 8 clients -- cut his content production time by 70% after switching to ContentKit prompts. He went from spending 12-15 hours per week writing client content to producing first drafts in 20-30 minutes. The quality improvement was significant enough that he raised his rates from $800/month to $1,400/month per client. Same clients, same scope -- just a better system.

I'd genuinely love your feedback on two things:

1. Which of the 8 categories would you use most? I want to double down on what matters to you.
2. Are there marketing channels or content types I'm missing that you'd want prompts for?

Thank you for checking out ContentKit. Every upvote and comment means a lot -- this has been months of prompt engineering and testing, and I'm excited to finally share it.

## Gallery Image Specs

### Image 1: Hero Image

- **Dimensions:** 1270 x 760 px
- **Content:** Large headline text reading "500+ AI Marketing Prompts. Copy. Paste. Publish." Below the headline, show a stylized mockup of the product -- a prompt template card with visible fields (Role, Framework, Variables, Output Format) alongside an AI chat window showing polished copy output. Include the ContentKit AI logo in the top-left corner and the URL getcontentkit.com in the bottom-right.
- **Visual style:** Clean, modern SaaS aesthetic. Dark background (deep navy or charcoal) with white text and accent color highlights (electric blue or coral) on key words. No clutter. The mockup should feel premium and minimal. Use a sans-serif font (Inter, Plus Jakarta Sans, or similar).

### Image 2: Category Overview

- **Dimensions:** 1270 x 760 px
- **Content:** Title at top: "8 Categories. 500+ Prompts. Every Marketing Channel Covered." Below, display a 2x4 grid of category cards, each with an icon and name:
  - Ads (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn) -- 65 prompts
  - Emails -- 65 prompts
  - Social Media -- 65 prompts
  - Landing Pages -- 60 prompts
  - SEO -- 60 prompts
  - Brand Strategy -- 55 prompts
  - Product Launch -- 65 prompts
  - Video Scripts -- 65 prompts
- **Visual style:** Light background (white or very light gray). Each category card has a subtle shadow, rounded corners, a simple line icon (e.g., megaphone for Ads, envelope for Emails, camera for Social Media), the category name in bold, and the prompt count below in a lighter weight. Grid should feel organized and scannable.

### Image 3: Before/After Prompt Comparison

- **Dimensions:** 1270 x 760 px
- **Content:** Split-screen layout. Left side labeled "Generic Prompt" with a red/orange tint, showing: a plain text prompt that reads "Write me a Facebook ad for my product." Below it, show a bland, generic AI output (3-4 lines of forgettable copy). Right side labeled "ContentKit Prompt" with a green/blue tint, showing: a structured prompt with visible sections (Role: Direct-response copywriter, Framework: PAS, Audience: [specific], Pain Point: [specific], CTA: [specific]). Below it, show a polished, conversion-ready Facebook ad output. At the bottom, a single line: "Same AI tool. Different prompt. Different result."
- **Visual style:** Clear visual contrast between left (dull, flat) and right (sharp, professional). Use a monospace or code-style font for the prompt text to make it feel like a real AI interface. The output on the right should feel noticeably more compelling even at a glance.

### Image 4: Social Proof / Results

- **Dimensions:** 1270 x 760 px
- **Content:** Title at top: "Real Results from Real Users." Feature the Marcus case study as the centerpiece:
  - Photo placeholder (silhouette or avatar icon) with "Marcus, Freelance Marketing Consultant"
  - Three stat blocks arranged horizontally:
    - "70% less time" (with subtext: "Content production time cut from 12-15 hrs/week to under 5 hrs")
    - "$800 to $1,400/mo" (with subtext: "Per-client rate increase after improving output quality")
    - "8 clients served" (with subtext: "Same client load, higher output volume and quality")
  - A brief quote: "ContentKit gave me a repeatable process. Each deliverable that used to take 3 hours now takes under an hour."
- **Visual style:** White or light background. Stats displayed in large, bold numbers with a colored accent (green for the positive metrics). Quote in italics with quotation marks. Clean, testimonial-style layout that feels credible and understated -- not hype-driven.

### Image 5: Pricing Comparison

- **Dimensions:** 1270 x 760 px
- **Content:** Title at top: "Two Plans. One-Time Payment. Lifetime Access." Show two pricing cards side by side:
  - **Left card -- Starter Kit ($147):**
    - 200+ prompts across all 8 categories
    - 30-day content calendar (Notion)
    - Lifetime access + free updates
    - Best for: individuals getting started
    - CTA: "Get Starter Kit"
  - **Right card -- Full Kit ($499) with a "Most Popular" badge:**
    - 500+ prompts across all 8 categories
    - 4 Notion templates (30-day calendar, 90-day calendar, brand strategy workspace, campaign planner)
    - Everything in Starter plus advanced prompts
    - Best for: freelancers and teams doing client work
    - CTA: "Get Full Kit"
  - Below both cards: "One-time payment. Instant download. 30-day money-back guarantee."
- **Visual style:** Clean card-based layout on a light background. The Full Kit card should be slightly larger or have a colored border/highlight to draw the eye. Use a subtle "Most Popular" ribbon or badge on the Full Kit. Pricing numbers should be the largest text on each card. Keep the comparison easy to scan at a glance.
