# ContentKit AI -- Product Hunt Launch Checklist

---

## Pre-Launch: Week 2 Before Launch (14-8 Days Out)

### Ship Page Setup
- [ ] Create the "Coming Soon" / Ship page on Product Hunt
- [ ] Upload the ContentKit AI logo (240x240 px) and a teaser thumbnail
- [ ] Write a short Ship page description: "500+ copy-paste AI prompts across 8 marketing categories. Paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini -- get professional marketing copy in seconds. Launching soon."
- [ ] Add the getcontentkit.com URL to the Ship page
- [ ] Set the target launch date on the Ship page

### Teaser Posts
- [ ] Post a teaser on X/Twitter: "Building something for marketers who are tired of getting garbage output from AI. 500+ prompts. 8 categories. Every marketing channel covered. Launching on @ProductHunt soon. Follow the Ship page: [SHIP PAGE LINK]"
- [ ] Post a teaser on LinkedIn: "I've spent months engineering AI prompts for marketing -- not generic ones, but prompts built with role assignment, copywriting frameworks, audience variables, and output formats. 500+ of them across 8 categories. Launching on Product Hunt [DATE]. More details soon."
- [ ] Share the Ship page link in 3-5 relevant Slack communities (marketing, solopreneur, AI, freelancer communities)
- [ ] Share the Ship page in 2-3 relevant Discord servers (indie makers, marketing, AI)
- [ ] Post in 2-3 relevant Reddit communities (r/marketing, r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS) -- provide value first, mention the upcoming launch naturally

### Community Prep
- [ ] Identify 20-30 people in your network who would genuinely upvote -- make a list with their names and preferred contact method
- [ ] Reach out to 5-10 maker friends on Product Hunt and let them know the launch date -- ask if they'd be willing to leave a comment
- [ ] Join 3-5 Product Hunt launch support groups (Slack, Discord, Facebook) and start engaging with other makers' launches (genuine engagement, not transactional)
- [ ] Follow 50+ relevant Product Hunt community members and engage with their activity

### Content Prep
- [ ] Draft a blog post for launch day: "Why We Built ContentKit AI -- The Problem with Generic AI Prompts"
- [ ] Create a short demo video or GIF showing the prompt-to-output workflow (30-60 seconds)

---

## Pre-Launch: Week 1 Before Launch (7-1 Days Out)

### Gallery Images
- [ ] Design Hero Image (1270x760 px) -- see listing-copy.md for specs
- [ ] Design Category Overview image (1270x760 px) -- see listing-copy.md for specs
- [ ] Design Before/After Prompt Comparison image (1270x760 px) -- see listing-copy.md for specs
- [ ] Design Social Proof / Results image (1270x760 px) -- see listing-copy.md for specs
- [ ] Design Pricing Comparison image (1270x760 px) -- see listing-copy.md for specs
- [ ] Review all images at actual Product Hunt gallery size -- ensure text is readable and contrast is strong
- [ ] Optional: Create a 6th image showing the Notion templates in action

### First Comment Draft
- [ ] Write and finalize the maker's first comment (see listing-copy.md for full draft)
- [ ] Have 1-2 people read the first comment for clarity and tone
- [ ] Prepare the comment in a document so you can copy-paste it immediately at launch

### Email Blast Draft
- [ ] Write and finalize the launch day email (see email-blast.md for full draft)
- [ ] Schedule the email in Kit for 6:00 AM PT on launch day -- but leave it in draft until the Product Hunt link is live
- [ ] Segment email list: prioritize engaged subscribers and previous purchasers
- [ ] Test the email with a small batch to check formatting and link rendering

### Hunter Outreach
- [ ] Identify 3-5 potential hunters (people with large Product Hunt followings in marketing/SaaS/AI)
- [ ] Send personalized outreach messages -- explain what ContentKit is, share why it's relevant to their audience, ask if they'd consider hunting it
- [ ] If no hunter is secured, plan to self-hunt (this is perfectly fine)
- [ ] Confirm the hunter (or self) and share all assets: tagline, description, gallery images, first comment, topics, and the product URL

### Final Prep
- [ ] Upload all listing assets to Product Hunt as a draft: tagline, description, gallery images, topics, maker profile, product URL
- [ ] Preview the listing in Product Hunt's draft mode -- check that everything renders correctly
- [ ] Prepare social media posts for launch day (see Launch Day schedule below) -- write them all in advance
- [ ] Set phone alarms for every launch day time slot
- [ ] Confirm the product page at getcontentkit.com is live, loads fast, and checkout works
- [ ] Add a "Featured on Product Hunt" badge placeholder to the ContentKit website (swap in the real badge after launch)

### 6:00 AM PT -- Social Media + Email Blast

**Action:** Share the launch across all social channels and send the email blast to your Kit subscribers.

**Platforms:** X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram Stories, email (Kit)

**X/Twitter post:**
"ContentKit AI is live on Product Hunt today. 500+ copy-paste AI prompts across 8 marketing categories -- ads, emails, social, landing pages, SEO, brand strategy, launches, and video scripts. Paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Get professional copy in seconds. Would love your support: [PRODUCT HUNT LINK]"

**LinkedIn post:**
"Today's the day -- ContentKit AI is live on Product Hunt.

After months of building, testing, and refining, I'm launching the AI Marketing Prompt Kit: 500+ pre-engineered prompts across 8 marketing categories, plus 4 Notion templates.

The problem I kept seeing: marketers type vague prompts into AI tools and get vague, unusable output. ContentKit fixes that. Every prompt is built with role assignment, a copywriting framework, audience variables, and a defined output format. You fill in your details, paste, and get professional copy.

If you have 10 seconds, an upvote on Product Hunt would mean the world:
[PRODUCT HUNT LINK]

And if you try it, I'd love to hear which category you find most useful."

**Instagram Stories:**
- Story 1: Screenshot of the Product Hunt listing with text overlay "We're LIVE on Product Hunt today"

4. If someone gives feedback, acknowledge it and explain your thinking
5. Check for any technical issues (broken links, image problems) and fix immediately

### 12:00 PM PT -- Mid-Day Social Push

**Action:** Second round of social media posts targeting a different angle. Focus on the case study / social proof.

**Platforms:** X/Twitter, LinkedIn, relevant Slack/Discord communities

**X/Twitter post:**
"One of our early users, Marcus, is a freelance marketing consultant serving 8 clients. After using ContentKit AI prompts, he cut his content production time by 70% and raised his rates from $800/mo to $1,400/mo per client. Same clients. Same scope. Better system. Check out what's inside: [PRODUCT HUNT LINK]"

**LinkedIn post (or comment on morning post):**
"Here's a quick story about why I built ContentKit AI.

Marcus is a freelance marketing consultant. He was spending 12-15 hours a week writing content for 8 clients. After switching to ContentKit's prompt templates, he now produces first drafts in 20-30 minutes. He went from delivering 1 email sequence per client per month to delivering 2-3 sequences, a full month of social content, and ad copy variations.

The result: he raised his rates from $800 to $1,400 per client because the output quality improved that much.

That's the power of well-engineered prompts. We're live on Product Hunt today: [PRODUCT HUNT LINK]"

**Slack/Discord communities:** Share a value-first message in relevant channels: "Hey everyone -- I launched ContentKit AI on Product Hunt today. It's 500+ copy-paste AI marketing prompts across 8 categories. If anyone here does content marketing or freelance writing, I think you'd find it genuinely useful. Here's the link if you want to check it out: [PRODUCT HUNT LINK]. Happy to answer any questions."

### 2:00 PM PT -- Respond to All Comments

**Steps:**
1. Respond to every new comment since 8:00 AM
2. Follow up on any threaded conversations
3. If someone left detailed feedback, write a thoughtful response explaining how you'll incorporate it

### 4:00 PM PT -- Afternoon Engagement Push

**Action:** Third round of social sharing. Target a different audience segment or angle -- focus on what's inside the kit.

**Reddit (if appropriate):** Only post in communities where self-promotion is allowed in designated threads (e.g., r/SideProject, r/indiehackers feedback threads). Frame it as a launch update, not a hard sell.
