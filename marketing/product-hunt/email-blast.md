## Body

Hi {{subscriber.first_name}},

Big day over here -- ContentKit AI just went live on Product Hunt, and I wanted you to be the first to know.

If you've been following along, you already know what ContentKit is: **500+ copy-paste marketing prompts across 8 categories** -- ads, emails, social media, landing pages, SEO, brand strategy, product launches, and video scripts. Every prompt is pre-engineered with role, framework, audience variables, and output format. You paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, fill in your details, and get professional marketing copy in seconds.

Plus 4 Notion templates to plan and organize everything you create.

One of our early users, Marcus -- a freelance marketing consultant -- used ContentKit to cut his content production time by 70% and raised his client rates from $800/month to $1,400/month. Same clients, same deliverables, just a better system behind the work.

**Here's my ask: would you upvote us on Product Hunt?**

It takes about 10 seconds and it makes a massive difference in how many people discover the product today.
