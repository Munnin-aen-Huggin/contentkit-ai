## Notes

- Review each image before posting and customize the caption template to match the specific visual content.
- Images with text overlays perform better on Twitter than images without text -- prioritize those.
- If an image performs exceptionally well (50+ likes), consider boosting it or creating a thread that expands on the tip.
- Track which caption templates get the highest engagement to refine the approach for future image batches.
- Coordinate with the main 30-day calendar so image posts do not go out at the same time as text posts. Morning = text post, afternoon = image post.
