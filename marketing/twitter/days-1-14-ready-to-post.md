# Days 1-14 — Ready to Post (Copy-Paste)

Everything below is the exact text to post for Days 1 through 14. No other file is needed. Just copy, paste, and post.

**Posting times:**
- Weekdays: 8-9 AM or 12-1 PM
- Weekends: 9-10 AM
- Threads: Tuesday mornings, 8 AM

## Day 1 — Monday
**Type:** Tip
**Best time:** 8-9 AM or 12-1 PM

**POST THIS:**

Most people prompt AI like this: "Write me a Facebook ad."

Try this instead: "Act as a direct-response copywriter. Write a PAS-framework Facebook ad for [product]. Target audience: [audience]. Pain point: [pain]."

The difference? Specificity. Role + framework + variables = usable output.

**After posting:** Pin this tweet for the first week.

---

## Day 2 — Tuesday
**Type:** Thread (10 tweets)
**Best time:** 8 AM

Post Tweet 1 first, then reply to it with Tweet 2, reply to Tweet 2 with Tweet 3, and so on — building a reply chain.

---

**TWEET 1 (post this as the main tweet):**

I replaced a $5,000/month copywriter with one AI prompt.

Not a tool. Not a subscription. One structured prompt.

Here's the exact prompt, the before/after output, and why it works:

---

**TWEET 2 (reply to Tweet 1):**

First, context. I was paying a freelance copywriter $5K/month to write Facebook ads for my brand.

The ads were decent. But turnaround was 5-7 days per batch, and revisions took another week.

I needed to move faster.

---

**TWEET 3 (reply to Tweet 2):**

I started testing AI for ad copy. The results were embarrassing.

Generic. Fluffy. Sounded like a robot wrote a brochure.

"Unlock your potential with our amazing solution!" — that kind of garbage.

The problem wasn't the AI. It was my prompt.

---

**TWEET 4 (reply to Tweet 3):**

Then I found a PAS-framework prompt (FB-01 from ContentKit AI). Here's the structure:

"Act as a direct-response copywriter. Write a PAS-framework Facebook ad for [PRODUCT]. Target audience: [AUDIENCE]. Pain point: [PAIN]. Agitate the emotional and financial cost. Solution: position [PRODUCT] as the fix. Include primary text (125 words), headline (under 40 chars), description (under 30 chars)."

---

**TWEET 5 (reply to Tweet 4):**

BEFORE (my generic prompt attempt):

"Write a Facebook ad for my proposal template."

Output: "Tired of boring proposals? Try our template pack! It's easy, fast, and affordable. Get started today!"

Zero specificity. Zero emotion. Zero conversions.

---

**TWEET 6 (reply to Tweet 5):**

AFTER (using the PAS prompt with variables filled in):

"You spent 4 hours on that proposal. Custom mockups. Personalized pricing. A cover page you were actually proud of. Then... nothing. No reply. No feedback. Just silence. That's 4 hours you'll never bill for — and it happens every month. ProposalKit gives you 12 proven templates that close. Clients see polished, professional proposals in 20 minutes, not 4 hours."

Headline: "Stop Losing Proposals"
CTA: Download

---

**TWEET 7 (reply to Tweet 6):**

Why does this work so much better?

Three reasons:

1. The prompt assigns a ROLE (direct-response copywriter) — AI writes differently when given expertise
2. It specifies a FRAMEWORK (PAS) — structure beats freestyle every time
3. It forces SPECIFICITY — real pain points, real audience, real format constraints

---

**TWEET 8 (reply to Tweet 7):**

Bonus: Because the prompt defines exact output format (primary text length, headline character limit, description limit), the output is platform-ready.

No editing. No reformatting. Paste it into Ads Manager.

I now produce ad variations in 10 minutes that used to take a week of back-and-forth.

---

**TWEET 9 (reply to Tweet 8):**

I'm not the only one. Marcus, a freelance marketing consultant serving 8 clients, started using structured prompts like these.

Result: 70% less writing time. Raised his rates from $800 to $1,400/month per client. Same clients, better output, fraction of the effort.

The shift wasn't his skill — it was his system.

---

**TWEET 10 (reply to Tweet 9):**

I put 500+ prompts like this into one kit — organized across ads, email, social, landing pages, brand strategy, video scripts, and more.

No subscriptions. No fluff. Just structured prompts that produce real output.

## Day 3 — Wednesday
**Type:** Engagement (Poll)
**Best time:** 8-9 AM or 12-1 PM

**POST THIS:**

What's your biggest time sink in marketing every week?

A) Writing social captions
B) Email copy
C) Ad copy
D) Landing pages

Reply with your answer — I'll share a prompt that cuts that task in half.

**After posting:** Respond to every reply with a relevant prompt tip. This builds reply threads that boost reach.

## Day 4 — Thursday
**Type:** Tip
**Best time:** 8-9 AM or 12-1 PM

**POST THIS:**

AI prompt hack: Always specify the output format.

Instead of "write me email subject lines," try:

"Write 20 subject line variants. 4 curiosity-gap, 4 direct benefit, 4 urgency, 4 social proof, 4 question. Each under 50 characters. Label by type."

You go from 3 generic lines to 20 testable options in 60 seconds.

**After posting:** No special action needed.

## Day 5 — Friday
**Type:** Commentary
**Best time:** 8-9 AM or 12-1 PM

**POST THIS:**

Hot take: The AI model you use matters less than the prompt you give it.

GPT-4, Claude, Gemini — they all produce similar quality when given a well-structured prompt with role, framework, variables, and format constraints.

The prompt IS the product. The AI is just the engine.

**After posting:** This is likely to generate debate. Engage with replies to drive more reach.

## Day 6 — Saturday
**Type:** Tip
**Best time:** 9-10 AM

**POST THIS:**

Want better LinkedIn posts from AI? Add this to your prompt:

"End with a discussion question that invites comments."

LinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes posts that generate conversations. One question at the end can 3x your reach.

**After posting:** No special action needed.

## Day 7 — Sunday
**Type:** Engagement
**Best time:** 9-10 AM

**POST THIS:**

Unpopular opinion time:

"You don't need to post every day to grow on social media."

Agree or disagree? Drop your take below.

**After posting:** Don't sell anything. Just reply and build community.

## Day 8 — Monday
**Type:** Tip
**Best time:** 8-9 AM or 12-1 PM

**POST THIS:**

The secret to AI-generated ad copy that converts:

Tell the AI WHO it is before telling it WHAT to write.

"Act as a direct-response copywriter specializing in Facebook ads" produces wildly different output than "Write a Facebook ad."

Role assignment is the most underrated prompt technique.

**After posting:** No special action needed.

## Day 9 — Tuesday
**Type:** Thread (10 tweets)
**Best time:** 8 AM

Post Tweet 1 first, then reply to it with Tweet 2, reply to Tweet 2 with Tweet 3, and so on — building a reply chain.

---

**TWEET 1 (post this as the main tweet):**

I found a prompt that generates 20 email subject lines in 60 seconds.

Across 5 psychological triggers. All under 50 characters. Organized for A/B testing.

Here's the prompt, the output, and how I use it:

---

**TWEET 2 (reply to Tweet 1):**

The average promotional email gets a 21% open rate. The difference between 21% and 35% is almost entirely the subject line.

Yet most marketers spend 30 seconds on it. Write one line, send, hope.

That's leaving money on the table every single send.

---

**TWEET 3 (reply to Tweet 2):**

The fix isn't writing better subject lines. It's testing more of them systematically.

You need volume AND variety. Four curiosity-gap lines, four benefit lines, four urgency lines — then test the best of each.

But writing 20 good subject lines from scratch takes an hour. Unless you have the right prompt.

---

**TWEET 4 (reply to Tweet 3):**

Prompt EM-19 (Subject Line Battery):

"Act as a subject line specialist. Write 20 email subject line variants for a promotional email about [PRODUCT NAME]. Generate 4 variants each of 5 types: (1) curiosity-gap, (2) direct benefit, (3) urgency/deadline, (4) social proof, (5) question. Each under 50 characters. Label by type. No clickbait."

---

**TWEET 5 (reply to Tweet 4):**

BEFORE (what I used to do):

Subject: "Check out our new product!"
Subject: "You're going to love this"
Subject: "Big announcement inside"

All the same trigger (vague curiosity). No variety. No system. No way to learn what works.

---

**TWEET 6 (reply to Tweet 5):**

AFTER (what the prompt produces):

Curiosity: "The marketing shortcut nobody talks about"
Benefit: "Write next month's emails in 20 min"
Urgency: "Launch price ends Friday at midnight"
Social proof: "Why 500+ marketers switched this week"
Question: "Still writing marketing copy from scratch?"

20 lines. 5 types. 60 seconds. Pick your top 2 per category and A/B test.

---

**TWEET 7 (reply to Tweet 6):**

Why this works: it forces CATEGORICAL variety.

Most marketers have a default trigger they gravitate toward (usually curiosity or benefit). This prompt forces you to test urgency, social proof, and questions too.

Your audience might respond to a trigger you've never tested because you never thought to write it.

---

**TWEET 8 (reply to Tweet 7):**

Pro tip: Pair this with EM-20 (Preview Text Optimization) from the same kit.

Subject line + preview text together determine your open rate. EM-20 generates 10 preview text variants that extend your subject line instead of repeating it.

Subject: "Still writing copy from scratch?"
Preview: "This 60-second method changes everything..."

That combo gets opens.

---

**TWEET 9 (reply to Tweet 8):**

Marcus used this approach across 8 client accounts. Instead of guessing one subject line per send, he generated 20 options per email, A/B tested the top 4, and iterated monthly.

His clients saw consistent open rate improvements. Same email body — better subject lines — more revenue per send.

---

**TWEET 10 (reply to Tweet 9):**

EM-19 is one of 50+ email prompts inside ContentKit AI — covering welcome sequences, nurture campaigns, cold outreach, re-engagement, subject lines, and more.

Stop guessing. Start testing.

## Day 11 — Thursday
**Type:** Commentary
**Best time:** 8-9 AM or 12-1 PM

**POST THIS:**

Everyone is talking about AI replacing marketers.

Here's what's actually happening: AI is replacing marketers who don't have systems.

The ones with structured workflows, prompt libraries, and repeatable processes? They're producing 3x the output and charging more for it.

The tool isn't the differentiator. The system is.

## Day 12 — Friday
**Type:** Tip
**Best time:** 8-9 AM or 12-1 PM

**POST THIS:**

When writing landing page copy with AI, don't ask for "a sales page."

Ask for each SECTION separately:

1. Hero headline + subheadline
2. Value proposition (one sentence)
3. Feature-to-benefit bullets
4. Social proof framing
5. FAQ section

5 focused prompts > 1 vague prompt. Every time.

**After posting:** No special action needed.

## Day 13 — Saturday
**Type:** Engagement
**Best time:** 9-10 AM

**POST THIS:**

Quick question for marketers using AI:

What's the ONE piece of marketing copy you still write from scratch every time?

(Mine used to be email subject lines — until I found a prompt that generates 20 variants in 60 seconds.)

**After posting:** Reply to responses and build conversation threads. Sets up future content about subject line prompts.

## Day 14 — Sunday
**Type:** Commentary
**Best time:** 9-10 AM

**POST THIS:**

The biggest misconception about AI copywriting:

People think AI writes your copy FOR you.

In reality, AI writes your FIRST DRAFT for you. The value isn't in eliminating writing — it's in eliminating the blank page.

Going from 0 to first draft is 80% of the effort. AI handles that. You handle the last 20%.

**After posting:** No special action needed. This post builds trust through honesty and manages expectations.
