### Day 1 — Monday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
Most people prompt AI like this: "Write me a Facebook ad."

Try this instead: "Act as a direct-response copywriter. Write a PAS-framework Facebook ad for [product]. Target audience: [audience]. Pain point: [pain]."

The difference? Specificity. Role + framework + variables = usable output.
**Notes:** Sets the tone for the account. Establishes the core thesis: prompt quality determines output quality. Pin this tweet for the first week.

---

### Day 2 — Tuesday
**Type:** Thread
**Content:**
Post Thread 1: "I replaced a $5K copywriter with one AI prompt" (see thread-templates.md)
**Notes:** First thread of the month. Tuesday morning, 8 AM. Reply to the thread with a link to the free prompt PDF for anyone who engages.

---

### Day 3 — Wednesday
**Type:** Engagement
**Content:**
What's your biggest time sink in marketing every week?

A) Writing social captions
B) Email copy
C) Ad copy
D) Landing pages

Reply with your answer — I'll share a prompt that cuts that task in half.
**Notes:** Poll format drives replies. Respond to every reply with a relevant prompt tip from the kit. This builds reply threads that boost reach.

---

### Day 4 — Thursday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
AI prompt hack: Always specify the output format.

Instead of "write me email subject lines," try:

"Write 20 subject line variants. 4 curiosity-gap, 4 direct benefit, 4 urgency, 4 social proof, 4 question. Each under 50 characters. Label by type."

You go from 3 generic lines to 20 testable options in 60 seconds.
**Notes:** This references EM-19 without naming it. Builds curiosity about the full kit.

---

### Day 5 — Friday
**Type:** Commentary
**Content:**
Hot take: The AI model you use matters less than the prompt you give it.

GPT-4, Claude, Gemini — they all produce similar quality when given a well-structured prompt with role, framework, variables, and format constraints.

The prompt IS the product. The AI is just the engine.
**Notes:** Positions ContentKit's core value proposition. Likely to generate debate, which drives engagement.

---

### Day 6 — Saturday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
Want better LinkedIn posts from AI? Add this to your prompt:

"End with a discussion question that invites comments."

LinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes posts that generate conversations. One question at the end can 3x your reach.
**Notes:** Weekend tip. Lighter content. Actionable and immediately useful even without the kit.

---

### Day 7 — Sunday
**Type:** Engagement
**Content:**
Unpopular opinion time:

"You don't need to post every day to grow on social media."

Agree or disagree? Drop your take below.
**Notes:** Sunday engagement bait. Low-effort post that drives comments. Don't sell anything — just build community.

---

### Day 8 — Monday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
The secret to AI-generated ad copy that converts:

Tell the AI WHO it is before telling it WHAT to write.

"Act as a direct-response copywriter specializing in Facebook ads" produces wildly different output than "Write a Facebook ad."

Role assignment is the most underrated prompt technique.
**Notes:** Reinforces the role-assignment concept. Building recurring theme that structured prompts beat generic ones.

---

### Day 9 — Tuesday
**Type:** Thread
**Content:**
Post Thread 3: "The prompt that writes emails people actually open" (see thread-templates.md)
**Notes:** Tuesday morning thread. Email subject lines are universally relevant — high share potential. Engage with replies by asking what industry they're in.

---

### Day 10 — Wednesday
**Type:** Lead Magnet CTA
**Content:**
I put together a free PDF with 5 of my best AI marketing prompts:

- PAS Facebook Ad prompt
- Email Subject Line Battery (20 variants)
- LinkedIn Thought Leadership post
- Instagram Carousel caption
- Landing Page Hero Section

No email required. Just grab it:
https://getcontentkit.com/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=promo#free-guide?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=lead-magnet

These are the same prompt structures used in the full ContentKit AI kit.
**Notes:** First promo post. Soft sell — free resource, no email gate. Drives traffic and builds goodwill. Track clicks to measure interest.

---

### Day 11 — Thursday
**Type:** Commentary
**Content:**
Everyone is talking about AI replacing marketers.

Here's what's actually happening: AI is replacing marketers who don't have systems.

The ones with structured workflows, prompt libraries, and repeatable processes? They're producing 3x the output and charging more for it.

The tool isn't the differentiator. The system is.
**Notes:** Industry commentary that positions ContentKit's worldview. Connects to the Marcus case study without naming it directly.

---

### Day 12 — Friday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
When writing landing page copy with AI, don't ask for "a sales page."

Ask for each SECTION separately:

1. Hero headline + subheadline
2. Value proposition (one sentence)
3. Feature-to-benefit bullets
4. Social proof framing
5. FAQ section

5 focused prompts > 1 vague prompt. Every time.
**Notes:** References the LP prompt series. Teaches the modular approach that makes ContentKit valuable.

---

### Day 13 — Saturday
**Type:** Engagement
**Content:**
Quick question for marketers using AI:

What's the ONE piece of marketing copy you still write from scratch every time?

(Mine used to be email subject lines — until I found a prompt that generates 20 variants in 60 seconds.)
**Notes:** Weekend engagement. Personal touch. Drives replies and sets up future content about subject line prompts.

---

### Day 14 — Sunday
**Type:** Commentary
**Content:**
The biggest misconception about AI copywriting:

People think AI writes your copy FOR you.

In reality, AI writes your FIRST DRAFT for you. The value isn't in eliminating writing — it's in eliminating the blank page.

Going from 0 to first draft is 80% of the effort. AI handles that. You handle the last 20%.
**Notes:** Manages expectations. Positions ContentKit as a starting-point tool, not a magic button. Builds trust through honesty.

---

### Day 15 — Monday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
Cold email tip: Never ask for a meeting in the first email.

Your first cold email's job is to start a conversation, not close a deal.

End with a small ask: "Worth a look? I can send a sample." NOT "Let's book 15 minutes on your calendar."

Small ask = higher reply rate. Always.
**Notes:** References EM-16 principles without naming the prompt. Practical, standalone value.

---

### Day 16 — Tuesday
**Type:** Thread
**Content:**
Post Thread 5: "5 prompts for LinkedIn posts that get engagement" (see thread-templates.md)
**Notes:** Tuesday morning thread. LinkedIn content resonates with the Twitter marketing audience since there's heavy overlap. Cross-platform appeal.

---

### Day 17 — Wednesday
**Type:** Social Proof
**Content:**
Real results from a ContentKit AI user:

Marcus, freelance marketing consultant, 8 clients:

Before: 12-15 hours/week writing client content
After: First drafts in 20-30 minutes using structured prompts

He raised his rates from $800 to $1,400/month per client. Same clients. Better output. 70% less writing time.

The shift wasn't his skill — it was his system.
**Notes:** First dedicated social proof post. Direct Marcus case study from the nurture emails. Let the results speak without a hard CTA.

---

### Day 18 — Thursday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
YouTube hack: Write 5 different hooks for every video, not just one.

Types to test:
1. Question hook
2. Shocking stat hook
3. Challenge hook ("I bet you can't...")
4. Story hook (start mid-story)
5. Curiosity gap hook

The first 30 seconds determine if anyone watches the rest. Test until you find what your audience responds to.
**Notes:** References VS-01. Useful even for people who never buy the kit. Builds authority in the video content space.

---

### Day 19 — Friday
**Type:** Engagement
**Content:**
If you could only use AI for ONE marketing task, which would you pick?

A) Writing ads
B) Writing emails
C) Writing social posts
D) Building brand strategy
E) Something else (reply below)

Curious what the biggest pain point is for this audience.
**Notes:** Market research disguised as engagement. Responses inform future content priorities and ad targeting.

---

### Day 20 — Saturday
**Type:** Commentary
**Content:**
AI prompt libraries are the new SaaS.

Think about it: a well-structured prompt that produces reliable, formatted output is essentially software. Input variables, get predictable results.

The difference: no monthly subscription. No login. No feature bloat. Just a prompt and your existing AI tool.

The best tools are the ones that don't feel like tools.
**Notes:** Weekend thought piece. Positions prompt libraries as a product category. Indirectly positions ContentKit without mentioning it.

---

### Day 21 — Sunday
**Type:** Engagement
**Content:**
Finish this sentence:

"The hardest part about marketing my business is ___________."

No wrong answers. Drop yours below.
**Notes:** Simple Sunday engagement. Open-ended question that generates a high volume of replies. Use responses to create future tip content.

---

### Day 22 — Monday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
Google Ads tip: Your Responsive Search Ad needs VARIETY, not volume.

Don't write 15 headlines from the same angle. Write:
- 5 problem-aware ("Tired of...")
- 5 solution-aware ("Get...")
- 5 action/CTA ("Start...")

Google's algorithm needs range to find winning combinations. Same angle x15 = wasted budget.
**Notes:** References GOOG-01 structure. Practical Google Ads advice that establishes expertise.

---

### Day 23 — Tuesday
**Type:** Thread
**Content:**
Post Thread 6: "Build your entire brand strategy with AI in one afternoon" (see thread-templates.md)
**Notes:** Tuesday morning thread. Brand strategy is aspirational content — people bookmark and share threads about big-picture strategy. High save rate expected.

---

### Day 24 — Wednesday
**Type:** Product Mention
**Content:**
I spent 6 months building ContentKit AI — 500+ structured marketing prompts across 8 categories:

- Facebook/Instagram Ads
- Google Ads
- Email Marketing (50+ prompts)
- Social Media
- Landing Pages
- Brand Strategy
- Product Launch
- Video Scripts

Every prompt includes the role, framework, variables to customize, and expected output format.

It's the system I wish I had when I started.

Starter Kit: $147 | Full Kit: $499
https://getcontentkit.com/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=promo
**Notes:** First direct product mention. Mid-week, sandwiched between value posts. Straightforward — no hype, just facts about what's included.

---

### Day 25 — Thursday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
Brand strategy prompt hack:

Run these 4 prompts IN ORDER for any new client or project:

1. Brand Positioning Statement
2. Ideal Customer Profile
3. Messaging Hierarchy
4. Tone of Voice Guide

Each output feeds the next. By prompt 4, your AI knows your brand well enough to write on-brand copy for any channel.

Total time: one afternoon.
**Notes:** References BS-01 through BS-04. Teaches the sequential workflow. Standalone value.

---

### Day 26 — Friday
**Type:** Social Proof
**Content:**
A ContentKit user ran the Instagram Carousel prompt (SM-01) eight times with different topics.

Result: 8 carousel posts — each with a caption, hook, swipe CTA, and 5 slide titles — produced in under 15 minutes.

That's a month of Instagram carousels. Before lunch.

Structured prompts don't just save time. They remove the decision fatigue that makes content creation feel exhausting.
**Notes:** Second social proof post. Specific, tangible result. Friday afternoon — light, results-focused content to end the work week.

---

### Day 27 — Saturday
**Type:** Commentary
**Content:**
The future of content marketing isn't more content. It's better systems for producing content.

The marketers who win in 2026 won't be the ones who write the most. They'll be the ones who produce consistent quality at speed — because they have a repeatable process.

AI is the engine. The prompt library is the playbook. The marketer is the strategist.

That's the stack.
**Notes:** Weekend big-picture commentary. Positions the prompt-library model as the future. No product mention — just worldview.

---

### Day 28 — Sunday
**Type:** Tip
**Content:**
Short-form video tip: Structure your 30-second Reel or TikTok like this:

0-3 sec: Claim the result ("Write a Facebook ad in 2 minutes")
3-18 sec: 3 specific steps (one action each)
18-24 sec: Show the outcome
24-30 sec: CTA

No intro. No "hey guys." Start with the result. Every second earns its place.
**Notes:** References VS-05 structure. Practical, immediately actionable. Sunday content for creators planning their Monday shoots.

---

### Day 29 — Monday
**Type:** Lead Magnet CTA
**Content:**
Want to test what structured AI prompts can do?

I'm giving away a free 5-prompt sample pack:

1. PAS Facebook Ad (the one from Thread 1)
2. 20-variant Subject Line Generator
3. LinkedIn Thought Leadership post
4. Hero Headline + Subheadline (5 options)
5. Instagram Carousel caption + slide titles

Free. No email required. Just grab it and test:
https://getcontentkit.com/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=promo#free-guide?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=lead-magnet

If these 5 save you time, imagine what 500+ would do.
**Notes:** Second lead magnet CTA. References earlier thread content so followers feel continuity. Last Monday of the month — drives traffic before the final push.

---

### Day 30 — Tuesday
**Type:** Thread + Product Mention
**Content:**
Post Thread 8: "I launched a product using only AI-written copy" (see thread-templates.md)

Follow up 2 hours after the thread with a reply:

"That's 10 of the 500+ prompts inside ContentKit AI.

If you've been reading these threads all month, you've seen what structured prompts produce. The full kit covers ads, email, social, landing pages, brand strategy, product launches, and video scripts.

Starter Kit ($147) or Full Kit ($499): https://getcontentkit.com/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=promo

Thanks for following along this month."
**Notes:** Final day. Thread + soft product mention in the reply. Feels like a natural conclusion to the month, not a sales push. The thread itself delivers full value; the CTA is a reply, not the thread.
