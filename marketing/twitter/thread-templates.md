### Thread 1: "I replaced a $5K copywriter with one AI prompt"

**Source prompts:** FB-01 (PAS Framework Facebook Ad)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I replaced a $5,000/month copywriter with one AI prompt.

Not a tool. Not a subscription. One structured prompt.

Here's the exact prompt, the before/after output, and why it works:

**Tweet 2:**
First, context. I was paying a freelance copywriter $5K/month to write Facebook ads for my brand.

The ads were decent. But turnaround was 5-7 days per batch, and revisions took another week.

I needed to move faster.

**Tweet 3:**
I started testing AI for ad copy. The results were embarrassing.

Generic. Fluffy. Sounded like a robot wrote a brochure.

"Unlock your potential with our amazing solution!" — that kind of garbage.

The problem wasn't the AI. It was my prompt.

**Tweet 4:**
Then I found a PAS-framework prompt (FB-01 from ContentKit AI). Here's the structure:

"Act as a direct-response copywriter. Write a PAS-framework Facebook ad for [PRODUCT]. Target audience: [AUDIENCE]. Pain point: [PAIN]. Agitate the emotional and financial cost. Solution: position [PRODUCT] as the fix. Include primary text (125 words), headline (under 40 chars), description (under 30 chars)."

**Tweet 5:**
BEFORE (my generic prompt attempt):

"Write a Facebook ad for my proposal template."

Output: "Tired of boring proposals? Try our template pack! It's easy, fast, and affordable. Get started today!"

Zero specificity. Zero emotion. Zero conversions.

**Tweet 6:**
AFTER (using the PAS prompt with variables filled in):

"You spent 4 hours on that proposal. Custom mockups. Personalized pricing. A cover page you were actually proud of. Then... nothing. No reply. No feedback. Just silence. That's 4 hours you'll never bill for — and it happens every month. ProposalKit gives you 12 proven templates that close. Clients see polished, professional proposals in 20 minutes, not 4 hours."

Headline: "Stop Losing Proposals"
CTA: Download

**Tweet 7:**
Why does this work so much better?

Three reasons:

1. The prompt assigns a ROLE (direct-response copywriter) — AI writes differently when given expertise
2. It specifies a FRAMEWORK (PAS) — structure beats freestyle every time
3. It forces SPECIFICITY — real pain points, real audience, real format constraints

**Tweet 8:**
Bonus: Because the prompt defines exact output format (primary text length, headline character limit, description limit), the output is platform-ready.

No editing. No reformatting. Paste it into Ads Manager.

I now produce ad variations in 10 minutes that used to take a week of back-and-forth.

**Tweet 9:**
I'm not the only one. Marcus, a freelance marketing consultant serving 8 clients, started using structured prompts like these.

Result: 70% less writing time. Raised his rates from $800 to $1,400/month per client. Same clients, better output, fraction of the effort.

The shift wasn't his skill — it was his system.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
I put 500+ prompts like this into one kit — organized across ads, email, social, landing pages, brand strategy, video scripts, and more.

No subscriptions. No fluff. Just structured prompts that produce real output.

### Thread 2: "Write a month of social content in 30 minutes"

**Source prompts:** SM-01 (Instagram Carousel), SM-06 (LinkedIn Thought Leadership)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I wrote an entire month of social media content in 30 minutes.

Not scheduling. Not repurposing. Writing from scratch — Instagram carousels + LinkedIn posts.

Here's the system (with the actual prompts):

**Tweet 2:**
The old way: Stare at a blank screen. Write one caption. Hate it. Rewrite. Check competitors. Rewrite again.

3 hours later, you have 2 posts. And you need 20+ for the month.

Most people quit content marketing here. Not because they lack ideas — because the production is brutal.

**Tweet 3:**
The fix: pre-structured prompts that tell AI exactly what format, length, tone, and structure to output.

Not "write me an Instagram post." That gives you garbage.

Instead: prompts engineered with specific frameworks, word counts, and platform-native formatting built in.

**Tweet 4:**
Prompt SM-01 (Instagram Carousel):

"Act as an Instagram content strategist. Write a carousel caption for a post teaching [TOPIC]. Caption structure: Hook (first line — must stop the scroll), 1-2 sentences expanding on what they'll learn, CTA to swipe. Under 100 words. Also suggest 5 slide titles for the carousel."

One prompt = one carousel post with slide outline. Run it 8 times with different topics = 8 carousels.

**Tweet 5:**
Prompt SM-06 (LinkedIn Thought Leadership):

"Act as a LinkedIn thought leadership writer. Write a long-form post on [TOPIC]. Structure: opening hook (strong statement or counterintuitive claim), main insight in 3-4 short paragraphs, one specific example, key takeaway, discussion question. 300-400 words. Short paragraphs for mobile."

One prompt = one LinkedIn post ready to publish.

**Tweet 6:**
Here's what 30 minutes actually looks like:

Minutes 1-5: List 12 topics for the month (3 per week)
Minutes 5-15: Run SM-01 eight times for Instagram carousels
Minutes 15-25: Run SM-06 eight times for LinkedIn posts
Minutes 25-30: Quick edit pass on the outputs

Result: 16 platform-ready posts. Add 4 more engagement posts manually = full month done.

**Tweet 7:**
The key insight: AI quality is directly proportional to prompt specificity.

SM-01 doesn't just say "write a caption." It specifies:
- The hook must work as a standalone scroll-stopper
- Under 100 words
- Includes slide titles for the designer

That level of structure is what separates usable output from throwaway drafts.

**Tweet 8:**
Pro tip: Batch by platform, not by day.

Do all your Instagram posts in one sitting, all your LinkedIn in another. Each platform has a different voice, and switching between them mid-batch kills your editing speed.

With structured prompts, you can produce 8 LinkedIn posts faster than you can write 2 from scratch.

**Tweet 9:**
Marcus, a freelance consultant managing 8 clients, used this exact approach. Before structured prompts: 12-15 hours/week on content. After: first drafts in 20-30 minutes per client.

He went from delivering one email sequence per client per month to 2-3 sequences PLUS a full month of social content PLUS ad variations.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
ContentKit AI has 60+ social media prompts across Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok, and Facebook — each with the framework, format, and structure built in.

Write a month of content before lunch.

### Thread 3: "The prompt that writes emails people actually open"

**Source prompts:** EM-19 (Email Subject Line Battery)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I found a prompt that generates 20 email subject lines in 60 seconds.

Across 5 psychological triggers. All under 50 characters. Organized for A/B testing.

Here's the prompt, the output, and how I use it:

**Tweet 2:**
The average promotional email gets a 21% open rate. The difference between 21% and 35% is almost entirely the subject line.

Yet most marketers spend 30 seconds on it. Write one line, send, hope.

That's leaving money on the table every single send.

**Tweet 3:**
The fix isn't writing better subject lines. It's testing more of them systematically.

You need volume AND variety. Four curiosity-gap lines, four benefit lines, four urgency lines — then test the best of each.

But writing 20 good subject lines from scratch takes an hour. Unless you have the right prompt.

**Tweet 4:**
Prompt EM-19 (Subject Line Battery):

"Act as a subject line specialist. Write 20 email subject line variants for a promotional email about [PRODUCT NAME]. Generate 4 variants each of 5 types: (1) curiosity-gap, (2) direct benefit, (3) urgency/deadline, (4) social proof, (5) question. Each under 50 characters. Label by type. No clickbait."

**Tweet 5:**
BEFORE (what I used to do):

Subject: "Check out our new product!"
Subject: "You're going to love this"
Subject: "Big announcement inside"

All the same trigger (vague curiosity). No variety. No system. No way to learn what works.

**Tweet 6:**
AFTER (what the prompt produces):

Curiosity: "The marketing shortcut nobody talks about"
Benefit: "Write next month's emails in 20 min"
Urgency: "Launch price ends Friday at midnight"
Social proof: "Why 500+ marketers switched this week"
Question: "Still writing marketing copy from scratch?"

20 lines. 5 types. 60 seconds. Pick your top 2 per category and A/B test.

**Tweet 7:**
Why this works: it forces CATEGORICAL variety.

Most marketers have a default trigger they gravitate toward (usually curiosity or benefit). This prompt forces you to test urgency, social proof, and questions too.

Your audience might respond to a trigger you've never tested because you never thought to write it.

**Tweet 8:**
Pro tip: Pair this with EM-20 (Preview Text Optimization) from the same kit.

Subject line + preview text together determine your open rate. EM-20 generates 10 preview text variants that extend your subject line instead of repeating it.

Subject: "Still writing copy from scratch?"
Preview: "This 60-second method changes everything..."

That combo gets opens.

**Tweet 9:**
Marcus used this approach across 8 client accounts. Instead of guessing one subject line per send, he generated 20 options per email, A/B tested the top 4, and iterated monthly.

His clients saw consistent open rate improvements. Same email body — better subject lines — more revenue per send.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
EM-19 is one of 50+ email prompts inside ContentKit AI — covering welcome sequences, nurture campaigns, cold outreach, re-engagement, subject lines, and more.

Stop guessing. Start testing.

### Thread 4: "I wrote a sales page in 45 minutes"

**Source prompts:** LP-01 (Hero Section), LP-03 (Feature-to-Benefit Bullets)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I wrote a complete sales page in 45 minutes.

Hero section. Value prop. Feature bullets. FAQ. Social proof framing.

Not a rough draft. A publishable page. Here's how:

**Tweet 2:**
Writing a sales page from scratch is one of the hardest copywriting tasks. Most people stare at a blank doc for hours.

Where do you start? The headline? The benefits? The objections?

The answer: you don't start from scratch. You build it section by section using structured prompts.

**Tweet 3:**
ContentKit AI has prompts for every section of a landing page — each one engineered to produce that specific section in the right format and length.

You don't write a "sales page." You assemble one from 5-6 prompt outputs.

Here are the two prompts that do the heaviest lifting:

**Tweet 4:**
Prompt LP-01 (Hero Headline + Subheadline):

"Act as a conversion copywriter. Write 5 hero headline + subheadline combinations for [PRODUCT]. Each headline: under 10 words, specific outcome, not a tagline. Each subheadline: 1-2 sentences on who it's for and what they get. Write 2 outcome-focused, 2 problem-led, 1 social proof-led."

5 options in 90 seconds. Pick the strongest. Done.

**Tweet 5:**
BEFORE (my old approach):

Headline: "The Ultimate Marketing Solution"
Subheadline: "Everything you need to grow your business"

Vague. Generic. Could be any product on earth. Visitors bounce in 3 seconds.

**Tweet 6:**
AFTER (LP-01 output):

Headline: "Write a Month of Marketing in One Afternoon"
Subheadline: "500+ AI prompts give solopreneurs and freelancers professional-grade ads, emails, and social posts — without hiring a copywriter or learning prompt engineering."

Specific outcome. Clear audience. Real mechanism. Visitors stay.

**Tweet 7:**
Prompt LP-03 (Feature-to-Benefit Bullets):

"Transform these 5 product features into benefit-first bullet points. Format: '[Benefit] — [brief feature explanation].' Each under 20 words. Lead with the buyer's gain, not the product's capability."

This prompt forces you to answer the buyer's real question: "So what does this do for ME?"

**Tweet 8:**
Before LP-03: "500 prompts across 8 categories"
After LP-03: "Never start from a blank page again — 500 ready-to-use prompts organized by marketing channel"

Before: "Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini"
After: "Use the AI tool you already have — every prompt works with any major AI model"

Features tell. Benefits sell. This prompt makes the conversion automatic.

**Tweet 9:**
My 45-minute workflow:
- LP-01: Hero section (10 min)
- LP-02: Value proposition (5 min)
- LP-03: Feature bullets (10 min)
- LP-04: Social proof framing (5 min)
- LP-05: FAQ section (10 min)
- Assembly + editing (5 min)

Marcus followed a similar modular approach for his client landing pages. Cut his page-writing time by over 60%. Raised his rates because his output quality improved across the board.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
ContentKit AI includes 10+ landing page prompts — from hero headlines to FAQ sections to testimonial framing.

Build a sales page in an afternoon, not a week.

### Thread 5: "5 prompts for LinkedIn posts that get engagement"

**Source prompts:** SM-06, SM-07, SM-08, SM-09

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
5 AI prompts that write LinkedIn posts people actually engage with.

Not generic "thought leadership." Real frameworks that get comments, shares, and saves.

I'll share each prompt and what it produces:

**Tweet 2:**
Most LinkedIn AI content sounds the same: "In today's fast-paced world... I believe that... Here are 3 tips..."

That's because everyone uses the same vague prompt: "Write me a LinkedIn post about X."

The fix: prompts built around specific LinkedIn post formats that the algorithm and readers reward.

**Tweet 3:**
Prompt 1 — SM-06 (Thought Leadership):

"Write a long-form LinkedIn post on [TOPIC]. Structure: opening hook (one strong statement or counterintuitive claim), main insight in 3-4 short paragraphs, one specific example, key takeaway, discussion question. 300-400 words. Short paragraphs for mobile."

The discussion question at the end is what drives comment volume. LinkedIn's algorithm surfaces posts that generate conversations.

**Tweet 4:**
Prompt 2 — SM-07 (Tactical How-To):

"Write a LinkedIn post teaching [FRAMEWORK]. Structure: Hook promising the framework. Steps 1-4 with labels and 2 sentences each. Closing takeaway. 250-350 words."

Tactical posts earn saves and bookmarks. Readers share them because they're genuinely useful — not just opinion pieces. Give people something they can implement today.

**Tweet 5:**
Prompt 3 — SM-08 (Personal Win — Humble Brag Done Right):

"Write a post sharing [WIN/MILESTONE]. Structure: state the win briefly, immediately pivot to what made it possible, turn the lesson into an audience takeaway, optional product mention. 200-300 words. Genuine and lesson-focused, not victory lap."

The secret: pivot from YOUR win to THEIR takeaway within the first 3 sentences.

**Tweet 6:**
Prompt 4 — SM-09 (Contrarian Take):

"Write a post challenging [COMMON BELIEF]. Structure: state the belief directly, your contrarian position in one sentence, 3 supporting arguments, nuance acknowledging what's true in the mainstream view, closing position. 300-400 words. Confident but not aggressive."

Contrarian posts get 3-5x more comments because people either agree enthusiastically or want to debate. Both behaviors boost reach.

**Tweet 7:**
The pattern across all 4 prompts:

1. Every prompt specifies a STRUCTURE (not just a topic)
2. Every prompt includes a word count range
3. Every prompt ends with an ENGAGEMENT driver (question, takeaway, debate)
4. Every prompt specifies mobile-friendly formatting

Structure is the difference between AI-generated slop and content that performs.

**Tweet 8:**
Bonus prompt — SM-10 (Twitter/X Thread):

"Write a 10-tweet thread on [TOPIC]. Tweet 1: promise + tease. Tweets 2-9: one insight per tweet, each under 280 characters and able to stand alone. Tweet 10: summary + CTA."

Yes — I used a ContentKit prompt to plan the structure of the thread you're reading right now.

**Tweet 9:**
These aren't hypothetical. Marcus, a freelance marketing consultant, used ContentKit's social prompts across 8 client accounts. He went from spending 12-15 hours/week on content to producing first drafts in 20-30 minutes.

Better output in less time. That's what happens when the prompt does the heavy lifting.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
ContentKit AI has 60+ social media prompts — for LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, and Facebook.

Each one built with platform-specific formatting, engagement drivers, and word count targets.

### Thread 6: "Build your entire brand strategy with AI in one afternoon"

**Source prompts:** BS-01 (Brand Positioning), BS-02 (ICP), BS-03 (Messaging Hierarchy), BS-04 (Tone of Voice)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Brand strategists charge $5K-$15K for a brand strategy document.

I built one in an afternoon using 4 AI prompts.

Positioning statement. ICP. Messaging hierarchy. Tone of voice guide. Here's each prompt:

**Tweet 2:**
Most founders skip brand strategy because it feels expensive and abstract. So they wing it — inconsistent messaging across every channel, no clear positioning, different tone in every email vs. ad vs. social post.

That inconsistency costs you conversions you never even see.

**Tweet 3:**
The fix: four prompts that produce the four foundational brand documents. Run them in order. Each one builds on the last. Total time: 2-3 hours.

You don't need a branding agency. You need the right questions asked in the right order.

**Tweet 4:**
Prompt 1 — BS-01 (Brand Positioning Statement):

"Write a positioning statement: 'For [TARGET AUDIENCE], [BRAND] is the [CATEGORY] that [UNIQUE VALUE] because [REASON TO BELIEVE].' Then expand to a 2-paragraph internal positioning doc, identify your primary competitor frame, and name the one thing you must be better at than anyone else."

This is your strategic foundation. Every other document flows from it.

**Tweet 5:**
Prompt 2 — BS-02 (Ideal Customer Profile):

"Write a detailed ICP including: demographic profile, psychographic profile, current situation, core problem, desired outcome, purchase triggers, top 3 objections, where they spend time online."

This prompt forces you to go beyond demographics into psychographics — values, self-image, aspirations, decision-making patterns. The ICP informs every piece of copy you write.

**Tweet 6:**
Prompt 3 — BS-03 (Messaging Hierarchy):

"Build a 3-level messaging hierarchy. Level 1: core brand message (one sentence). Level 2: audience segment messages — 3 variations for [SEGMENT 1/2/3]. Level 3: channel-specific messages — adapt Level 2 for website, Facebook ads, and email subject lines."

This is the document that makes your messaging consistent without making it repetitive. Same core idea, different language for each audience and channel.

**Tweet 7:**
Prompt 4 — BS-04 (Tone of Voice Guide):

"Write a tone of voice guide: 4 adjectives characterizing the brand voice (with 2-sentence explanations), voice dials (where the brand sits on a spectrum), 5 do/don't phrase pairs, and platform variations for email vs. social vs. ads."

Hand this document to any writer, VA, or AI tool. Your brand sounds like your brand everywhere.

**Tweet 8:**
The order matters:

1. Positioning (who you are) informs ->
2. ICP (who you serve) informs ->
3. Messaging hierarchy (what you say) informs ->
4. Tone of voice (how you say it)

Skip to tone of voice without positioning and you're decorating a house with no foundation. Do them in sequence, and each prompt output makes the next one sharper.

**Tweet 9:**
Marcus ran these prompts for each of his 8 clients. Before: each client had scattered messaging and no documented strategy. After: clear positioning docs he could hand off to anyone.

That systematization is what let him raise rates from $800/month to $1,400/month per client. Clients pay more when the output is consistent and strategic.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
ContentKit AI includes 15+ brand strategy prompts — from positioning to competitive differentiation to brand story.

Build a strategy document your brand can actually use.

### Thread 7: "Google Ads prompts that actually convert"

**Source prompts:** GOOG-01 (Responsive Ad Headlines), GOOG-02 (Ad Descriptions)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Most Google Ads are written by marketers guessing at headlines.

Here are 2 AI prompts that generate a complete Responsive Search Ad — 15 headlines and 4 descriptions — in under 5 minutes.

Structured, labeled, and ready to paste into Ads Manager:

**Tweet 2:**
Google Responsive Search Ads need 8-15 headlines (30 chars each) and 2-4 descriptions (90 chars each). Google mixes and matches them algorithmically.

Most advertisers write 8 mediocre headlines from the same angle and hope for the best.

The result: low Ad Strength scores, poor click-through, wasted budget.

**Tweet 3:**
The fix: prompts that force CATEGORICAL variety across intent signals.

Not 15 versions of the same benefit. Instead: 5 problem-aware headlines, 5 solution-aware headlines, 5 action/CTA headlines.

Google's algorithm needs variety to find winning combinations. Give it range.

**Tweet 4:**
Prompt GOOG-01 (Responsive Search Ad Headlines):

"Write 15 responsive search ad headlines (max 30 chars each) for [PRODUCT]. Target keyword: [KEYWORD]. Distribute: 5 problem-aware (speak to the pain), 5 solution-aware (feature/outcome), 5 action/CTA (drive the click). Include [PRICE] in at least 2 headlines."

15 headlines. Three intent categories. Character-count compliant. Ready to paste.

**Tweet 5:**
BEFORE (typical headline set):

"AI Marketing Prompts" / "Best AI Prompt Kit" / "AI Prompts for Marketing" / "Buy AI Prompts Now" / "Marketing Made Easy"

Same angle repeated 5 ways. No pain awareness. No specificity. Google can't optimize because there's nothing to optimize across.

**Tweet 6:**
AFTER (GOOG-01 output):

Problem: "Tired of Blank Page Syndrome?" / "Stop Wasting Hours on Copy"
Solution: "500+ Marketing Prompts Ready" / "Write Ads in 5 Minutes Flat"
CTA: "Get the Prompt Kit — $147" / "Start Writing Better Today"

Three angles. Google mixes and matches. Ad Strength score goes up. CTR follows.

**Tweet 7:**
Prompt GOOG-02 (Descriptions):

"Write 4 responsive search ad descriptions (max 90 chars each) for [PRODUCT]. One each for: primary benefit, social proof signal, urgency/offer, feature differentiation vs. competitors. Each must include a CTA or action phrase."

Four descriptions, four distinct angles. Google serves the right description for the right search context.

**Tweet 8:**
Pro tip: Run GOOG-01 once per ad group, not once per campaign.

Each ad group targets a different keyword cluster. Tailor the [TARGET KEYWORD] variable to each cluster and you get headlines that match search intent precisely.

One prompt, different variables, perfectly segmented ad copy across your entire account.

**Tweet 9:**
Marcus used structured ad prompts for his clients' Google campaigns. Instead of spending hours per ad group writing headlines, he generated complete ad sets in minutes.

The time savings compounded across 8 client accounts. More testing, faster iteration, better results — all from having a system instead of starting from scratch.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
ContentKit AI includes 10+ Google Ads prompts — Responsive Search Ads, Shopping descriptions, Display banners, Performance Max asset sets, and more.

Stop guessing at headlines. Start with structure.

### Thread 8: "I launched a product using only AI-written copy"

**Source prompts:** PL-01 (Waitlist Landing Page), PL-02 (Launch Email), PL-03 (Product Hunt Post), PL-05 (Launch Social Posts)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I launched a digital product using only AI-written copy.

Waitlist page. Launch email. Product Hunt post. Social announcements across 5 platforms.

Total copywriting time: 2 hours. Here's the exact workflow:

**Tweet 2:**
Most product launches fail at the copy stage. Not because the product is bad — because writing launch copy is overwhelming.

You need a landing page, an email sequence, social posts for 5 platforms, and a Product Hunt listing. That's 15+ pieces of copy, all needed on the same day.

Most people get 3 pieces done and launch half-baked.

**Tweet 3:**
The fix: a prompt-driven launch workflow. Four prompts, run in sequence, producing every piece of launch copy you need.

Each prompt is designed for its specific platform and purpose. Not "write me launch copy" — precise, structured, format-ready prompts.

**Tweet 4:**
Step 1 — PL-01 (Waitlist Landing Page):

"Write a waitlist landing page for [PRODUCT] launching on [DATE]. Include: headline (what's coming and who it's for, under 12 words), 3-sentence tease (enough specifics to create desire, not enough to satisfy it), waitlist benefit, and email form copy."

Run this 2-4 weeks before launch. Start building your list while you finalize the product.

**Tweet 5:**
Step 2 — PL-02 (Launch Announcement Email):

"Write the launch announcement email to waitlist subscribers. Structure: acknowledge their wait with genuine appreciation, announce it's live with a direct link, exclusive access window, waitlist-only benefit, 3 bullets of what's inside, CTA."

This goes to your warmest leads. They signed up for this moment. The email must make them feel like insiders.

**Tweet 6:**
Step 3 — PL-03 (Product Hunt Post):

"Write the Product Hunt launch package: tagline (under 60 chars), description (under 260 chars), first maker comment (150-200 words — personal story, who it's for, 3 things it does, what you want feedback on)."

The maker comment is what drives upvotes. It needs to sound like a founder, not a marketing team. This prompt nails that tone.

**Tweet 7:**
Step 4 — PL-05 (Launch Social Posts — 5 platforms):

"Write launch day posts for [PRODUCT] across Twitter/X (under 280 chars), LinkedIn (200-300 words), Instagram (150 words + hashtags), Facebook (150 words), TikTok (3-sentence caption). Each must feel native to the platform."

One prompt. Five platforms. Each post sounds like it was written specifically for that platform — because the prompt specifies platform-native formatting.

**Tweet 8:**
The 2-hour launch copy timeline:

- Hour 1: Run PL-02 (launch email) + PL-03 (Product Hunt) + PL-05 (social posts)
- Hour 2: Edit all outputs, load into email platform, schedule social posts, prepare Product Hunt listing

That's a complete multi-channel launch. No copywriter. No agency. No frantic midnight writing sessions.

**Tweet 9:**
Marcus used this launch workflow approach across client campaigns. The structured prompts gave him complete launch packages in a fraction of the time — letting him serve more clients without sacrificing quality.

He went from delivering basic deliverables to comprehensive multi-channel launches. That's what earned him the rate increase from $800 to $1,400/month per client.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
ContentKit AI includes 10+ product launch prompts — waitlist pages, launch emails, Product Hunt copy, press releases, social announcements, and full launch week email sequences.

Launch like a team of 5. By yourself.

### Thread 9: "Stop writing cold emails from scratch"

**Source prompts:** EM-16 (Cold Outreach), EM-17 (Follow-Up Sequence)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Cold email response rates average 1-5%.

But most cold emails fail for the same reason: they lead with the pitch instead of the prospect's problem.

Here are 2 prompts that fix cold outreach permanently:

**Tweet 2:**
The typical cold email:

"Hi, my name is [Name] and I'm the founder of [Company]. We help businesses [vague benefit]. I'd love to schedule a call to discuss how we can help you."

That email gets deleted in 2 seconds. No one cares who you are. They care about their problem.

**Tweet 3:**
The fix isn't writing "better" cold emails. It's using a structure that leads with the prospect's world, not yours.

These two prompts produce a complete cold outreach sequence: the initial email and three follow-ups. Each one adds new value instead of just asking "did you see my last email?"

**Tweet 4:**
Prompt EM-16 (Cold Outreach):

"Write a cold outreach email targeting [COMPANY TYPE]. Subject line: reference something specific about their role. Body (150 words max): one sentence on who you are, identify a specific problem they likely have, one sentence on what you do about it, one result or proof, small ask — not a calendar link."

The key constraint: "not a calendar link." The first email's job is to start a conversation, not close a meeting.

**Tweet 5:**
BEFORE (generic cold email):

Subject: "Quick question"
"Hi, I run an AI marketing tool. We've helped hundreds of businesses. I'd love to get 15 minutes on your calendar to discuss..."

No specificity. No proof. Asks for too much too fast. Delete.

**Tweet 6:**
AFTER (EM-16 output):

Subject: "The content bottleneck for 5-15 person agencies"
"You're running a boutique agency with a dozen clients, and every one of them needs fresh copy monthly. That's 40+ pieces of content your team has to produce — and most agencies this size don't have a dedicated copywriter. ContentKit gives your team 500+ structured AI prompts. One agency cut their content production time by 70%. Worth a look? I can send 10 prompts relevant to agency work — no call needed."

Specific. Relevant. Small ask.

**Tweet 7:**
Prompt EM-17 (Follow-Up Sequence — 3 emails):

"Write a 3-email follow-up sequence. Email 1 (Day 3): add one new piece of value — a specific insight or result. Email 2 (Day 7): try a different angle — address a different pain point. Email 3 (Day 14): polite final ask — acknowledge this is the last email. Each under 100 words."

Each follow-up adds new value or a new angle. Never "just following up."

**Tweet 8:**
Why this structure works:

1. The initial email identifies THEIR problem (not your product)
2. Follow-up 1 adds proof (not repetition)
3. Follow-up 2 tries a new angle (if pain #1 didn't resonate, try pain #2)
4. Follow-up 3 respects their inbox (last email, easy out)

Most replies come from follow-ups 2 and 3 — but only if they add value. Repetition kills response rates.

Marcus applied this structured outreach approach when prospecting for new clients. Instead of drafting cold emails from scratch for each prospect type, he ran the prompts with different variables for different industries.

Same framework. Different inputs. Personalized output for each prospect segment — in minutes instead of hours.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
ContentKit AI includes prompts for cold outreach, follow-up sequences, warm re-engagement, referral requests, and 45+ more email templates.

Your outreach deserves better than "just following up."

### Thread 10: "The AI video script prompt that gets 10x views"

**Source prompts:** VS-01 (YouTube Hooks), VS-05 (Instagram/TikTok How-To)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
The first 30 seconds of your video determine whether anyone watches the rest.

Most creators wing the hook. Here are 2 AI prompts that write scroll-stopping video scripts — for YouTube AND short-form.

The actual prompts and example output:

**Tweet 2:**
YouTube retention data is brutal: most viewers click away within 15 seconds.

If your hook doesn't immediately create a reason to keep watching, nothing else matters. Not your editing. Not your B-roll. Not your value.

The hook IS the video for 80% of your audience.

**Tweet 3:**
The problem with winging it: you default to the same hook style every time.

"Hey guys, in today's video we're going to talk about..."

That's not a hook. That's an announcement. Announcements don't create retention. Pattern interrupts do.

**Tweet 4:**
Prompt VS-01 (YouTube Hook — 5 Variants):

"Write 5 first-30-second hook scripts for a video about [TOPIC]. Each must create pattern interruption and promise specific value. Types: (1) Question hook, (2) Shocking stat hook, (3) Challenge hook, (4) Story hook (open mid-story), (5) Curiosity gap hook. Each 75-100 words, timestamped."

Five different hooks for one video. Test them. Find what your audience responds to.

**Tweet 5:**
BEFORE (default hook):

"Hey everyone, today I'm going to show you how to write Facebook ads using AI. This is going to be really helpful, so stick around to the end. Let's get started."

Zero tension. Zero curiosity. Zero reason to keep watching. 80% drop-off.

**Tweet 6:**
AFTER (VS-01 — Shocking Stat Hook):

"[0:00] 94% of Facebook ads lose money. Not break even — lose money. [0:05] But there's a prompt structure that consistently produces ads that convert — and it takes less than 2 minutes. [0:12] I'm going to show you the exact prompt, run it live, and show you the output side by side with a $3,000 agency-written ad. [0:22] By the end of this video, you'll have a better ad than most agencies deliver."

Specific stat. Clear promise. Stakes established. Viewer stays.

**Tweet 7:**
Prompt VS-05 (Instagram Reel / TikTok How-To — 30 seconds):

"Write a 30-second 'how to [TASK]' script. Structure: Hook (0-3 sec — claim the result), Step 1 (3-10 sec), Step 2 (10-18 sec), Step 3 (18-24 sec), CTA (24-30 sec). Include on-screen text notes. ~80 spoken words."

Short-form has zero margin for waste. Every second must deliver value or drive curiosity. This prompt forces that discipline.

**Tweet 8:**
Example VS-05 output:

"[0:00] Write a Facebook ad in 2 minutes. Here's how. [ON-SCREEN: 'AI Ad Hack']
[0:03] Step 1: Tell AI to act as a direct-response copywriter and specify the PAS framework.
[0:10] Step 2: Fill in your product, audience, and their biggest pain point.
[0:18] Step 3: Add format constraints — 125 words, headline under 40 characters, one CTA.
[0:24] The output is paste-ready for Ads Manager. Link in bio for 500+ prompts like this."

30 seconds. Three steps. One CTA. Film it in one take.

**Tweet 9:**
Marcus used structured scripts for client content that included video. The prompts eliminated the "what do I say?" problem that keeps most people from hitting record.

When the script is written — with hooks, steps, and CTAs already structured — production time drops dramatically. That's how he scaled content delivery across 8 clients simultaneously.

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
ContentKit AI includes 10+ video script prompts — YouTube hooks, full tutorials, channel trailers, VSLs, short-form scripts, and interview intros.

Stop winging your scripts. Start with structure.
