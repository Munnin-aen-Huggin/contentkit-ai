## Article Outline

### Introduction (200-300 words)
- Hook: "A professional copywriter charges $3,000-$5,000 for a single sales page rewrite. An email sequence with five emails runs another $1,500-$3,000. A full launch package — ad copy, landing page, email sequence — can reach $8,000-$12,000. For most small businesses, that math does not work."
- Problem: Businesses need professional-grade copy across every channel — ads, emails, landing pages, social — but cannot afford to hire a copywriter for every asset. They turn to AI, but generic prompts produce generic copy that sounds like it was written by a committee of no one in particular.
- Promise: This article gives you 20 free AI copywriting prompts — the exact templates that produce usable first drafts for the three highest-ROI copy types: ads, emails, and landing pages. Each prompt is engineered with a specific copywriting framework, role assignment, and variable structure.
- Keyword placement: "ai copywriting prompts free" in the first paragraph naturally ("If you have been looking for ai copywriting prompts free of charge, most of what you have found is probably a list of vague one-liners...")
- Social proof hook: "These prompts are built on the same engineering used in ContentKit AI, where one freelancer used the system to cut content time by 70% and raise his rates from $800 to $1,400/month per client."

### H2: The Copywriting Framework That Makes AI Prompts Work (300-400 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - Why frameworks matter: AI without a framework produces freeform text. AI with a framework produces structured, persuasive copy.
  - The 4 copywriting frameworks embedded in these prompts:
    1. **PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve):** Best for ads and short-form sales copy. Open with the pain, amplify the cost of inaction, present the solution.
    2. **AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action):** Best for landing pages and longer sales copy. Hook attention, build interest with specifics, create desire through benefits, drive action with a CTA.
    3. **Before-After-Bridge:** Best for email and social content. Show the current state (before), paint the desired state (after), position your product as the bridge.
    4. **"What's Inside" Structure:** Best for launch emails and product announcements. Skip the persuasion, lead with specifics. Tell them exactly what they get.
  - Each prompt in this article tells the AI which framework to use — so you do not need to know copywriting theory to produce copy that follows it
- Include: A quick-reference table matching framework to use case (e.g., PAS = Facebook ads, AIDA = landing pages, BAB = nurture emails, "What's Inside" = launch emails)

### H2: How to Customize These Prompts for Your Business (300 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - Step 1: Replace every bracketed variable with your specific details — the more specific you are, the better the output. "[TARGET AUDIENCE]: freelancers aged 25-40 who charge under $3K per project" beats "[TARGET AUDIENCE]: freelancers."
  - Step 2: Run the prompt, then use a follow-up refinement prompt. Examples: "Rewrite the headline using a curiosity gap angle," "Make the tone 20% more conversational," "Cut the body copy to under 100 words."
  - Step 3: Edit the last 20% — AI produces the structure and the language patterns. You add brand voice, specific data, personal anecdotes, and factual accuracy.
  - Step 4: Chain prompts across channels. Use the winning ad angle from Prompt 1 as the [MAIN BENEFIT] variable in Prompt 14 (hero section) and Prompt 7 (launch email). Consistency across channels.
  - Reference Marcus: his system was "pick the right category, fill in the client variables, generate multiple options, refine the best one." Each deliverable that used to take 3 hours now takes under an hour.

### H2: FAQ — Free AI Copywriting Prompts (300-400 words)
- **Q: Are these AI copywriting prompts really free?**
  A: Yes. The 20 prompts in this article are free to copy and use. The downloadable PDF ("5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter") is also free — no credit card required. For the full library of 500+ prompts, ContentKit AI starts at $147.
- **Q: Do these prompts work for any industry?**
  A: Yes. The prompts use bracketed variables ([TARGET AUDIENCE], [PAIN POINT], etc.) that you customize for your industry. They have been used for SaaS, e-commerce, coaching, consulting, agencies, and local services.
- **Q: Can I use AI-generated copy directly, or do I need to edit it?**
  A: Always edit. AI produces roughly 80% of a professional copywriter's output. The remaining 20% — brand voice, specific data points, legal compliance, personal stories — requires human judgment. Think of these prompts as first-draft generators, not finished-copy machines.
- **Q: What is the difference between a "prompt" and a "template"?**
  A: In this context, they are the same thing. A prompt is the instruction you paste into ChatGPT or Claude. A template is a prompt with pre-defined structure and variables. Every prompt in this article is a template — structured, variable-driven, and ready to customize.
- **Q: How do these compare to hiring a freelance copywriter?**
  A: A mid-tier freelance copywriter charges $100-$250/hour. A sales page rewrite runs $3,000-$5,000. These prompts produce a strong first draft in 3-5 minutes. The trade-off: AI copy requires editing and does not replace strategic thinking. For high-volume, repeatable copy tasks (ads, emails, social), prompts are dramatically more efficient. For one-time, high-stakes projects (brand positioning, flagship sales page), a human copywriter may still be worth the investment.

### Conclusion (150-200 words)
- Summary: These 20 free AI copywriting prompts cover the three highest-ROI copy types — ads, emails, and landing pages. Each prompt is built on a proven copywriting framework (PAS, AIDA, Before-After-Bridge, "What's Inside") with role assignments, variable structures, and output constraints that make AI produce usable first drafts.
- The cost comparison: "A professional copywriter charges $3,000-$5,000 for a sales page, $1,500-$3,000 for an email sequence, and $300-$600 for a single Facebook ad. These prompts produce first drafts for all of those in under 30 minutes."
