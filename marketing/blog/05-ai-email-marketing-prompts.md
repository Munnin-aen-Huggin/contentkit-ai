## Article Outline

### Introduction (200-300 words)
- Hook: "Email marketing has the highest ROI of any digital channel — $36 for every $1 spent, according to DMA. But that number only holds if the emails are good. And most AI-generated emails are not good. They are the kind of emails that get opened once and train readers to ignore everything you send after."
- Problem: Marketers know they need email sequences — welcome series, nurture campaigns, promotional sends, re-engagement flows. But writing them is slow (a 5-email sequence takes 8-12 hours from scratch) and expensive (a freelance email copywriter charges $150-$300 per email). So they turn to AI, type "write me a welcome email," and get something so generic it could be from any brand in any industry.
- Promise: This article gives you AI email marketing prompts for the three sequence types every business needs: welcome, nurture, and sales. Each prompt is engineered with a specific email framework, role assignment, tone parameters, and variable structure — so ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini produces emails you would actually send.
- Keyword placement: "ai email marketing prompts" in the opening of paragraph 3 ("The right ai email marketing prompts do not just generate words — they generate emails structured around proven conversion frameworks.")
- Case study preview: "A freelance marketing consultant named Marcus used structured email prompts to go from delivering one email sequence per client per month to delivering 2-3 sequences — while cutting his production time by 70% and raising his rates from $800 to $1,400/month."

### H2: Why Most AI Email Copy Sounds Like Spam (300-400 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - The "corporate robot" problem: AI defaults to formal, impersonal language when generating email copy. "We are excited to announce..." and "Don't miss this limited-time opportunity!" are the hallmarks of AI email output without proper prompting.
  - The three reasons AI email copy fails:
    1. **No sender persona:** Without a role assignment, AI writes as a generic brand instead of a specific person with a voice, perspective, and personality. The fix: "Act as a direct-response email copywriter who writes in a conversational, first-person tone."
    2. **No structural framework:** Without a framework, AI produces a blob of text with no strategic architecture. Each email type has a proven structure — welcome emails set expectations, nurture emails teach one concept, sales emails present an offer with urgency. The prompt must specify this.
    3. **No audience specificity:** "[TARGET AUDIENCE]: email subscribers" tells the AI nothing. "[TARGET AUDIENCE]: freelance marketing consultants who serve 5-10 small business clients and want to increase their output without hiring" tells the AI everything it needs to match tone, examples, and pain points.
  - Reference the nurture email (Day 2): the comparison between "write me an email subject line for my sale" vs. the engineered prompt with role, audience, tone, angle, and constraints. The first produces garbage. The second produces subject lines you would actually test.
- Include: A before/after example — the same email brief sent with a generic prompt vs. a structured prompt

### H2: AI Prompts for Welcome Email Sequences (500-600 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - Welcome sequences are the highest-leverage emails you send — new subscribers are most engaged in the first 48 hours. A weak welcome sequence trains them to ignore you.
  - The welcome sequence structure: 3-5 emails over 7-10 days, each with a distinct job
  - **Prompt 1: Welcome Email — Lead Magnet Delivery (Day 0)** — reference prompt EM-01
    - Full copy-paste prompt:
      - Role: "Act as an email marketing strategist who writes welcome sequences for digital product businesses"
      - Structure: Subject line with clear download reference, immediate delivery of the lead magnet, 1-2 sentences of context on what the reader will get from it, brief sender introduction (1 sentence), expectation setting for what emails come next, sign-off
      - Output: Under 150 words. No selling. Tone: helpful, direct, zero fluff.
      - Variables: [BRAND NAME], [LEAD MAGNET TITLE], [DOWNLOAD LINK], [EMAIL FREQUENCY], [SENDER NAME]
    - Reference the actual ContentKit lead magnet delivery email (nurture Email 1, Day 0) as a structural example — note how it delivers the PDF immediately, explains what is inside in one sentence, and closes with "More coming your way over the next few days"
  - **Prompt 2: Welcome Email — Value/Credibility (Day 2)** — reference prompt EM-04
    - Full copy-paste prompt:
      - Role: same as above
      - Structure: Open with a relatable question that surfaces a common mistake. Describe the mistake in specific terms. Provide the correct approach with a concrete before/after example. Position the sender's expertise subtly — through the quality of the insight, not through credentials.
      - Output: 200-300 words. Teach one specific, actionable concept. No selling.
      - Variables: [COMMON MISTAKE], [WHY IT HAPPENS], [BETTER APPROACH EXAMPLE], [BRAND NAME]
    - Reference the Day 2 nurture email structure: opens with "Quick question: when you open a fresh ChatGPT chat and type 'write me an Instagram caption,' what do you get?", teaches the character brief concept, ends with subtle positioning
  - **Prompt 3: Welcome Email — Product Introduction (Day 4)** — reference prompt EM-06
    - Brief structure: First email that mentions the product. Explains what it is in plain language (not marketing language). Lists who it is for. Describes how it is different from alternatives. Includes pricing and CTA. No urgency — this is an introduction, not a sales push.
    - Variables: [PRODUCT NAME], [PRODUCT DESCRIPTION — plain language], [WHO IT'S FOR], [HOW IT'S DIFFERENT], [PRICING], [CTA LINK]
    - Reference the Day 4 nurture email structure (Email 3) as a model
  - **Prompt 4: Welcome Email — Social Proof/Case Study (Day 6)** — reference prompt EM-08
    - Brief structure: Tell one customer story with specific before/after results. Use the format: Context (who they are, what they were struggling with), Before (specific metrics or pain points), After (specific results), System (what they did differently). Close with a product CTA.
    - Variables: [CUSTOMER NAME], [CUSTOMER CONTEXT], [BEFORE METRICS], [AFTER METRICS], [SYSTEM/PRODUCT], [CTA LINK]
    - **Use the Marcus case study as the specific example to reference:**
      - Marcus: freelance marketing consultant, 8 clients
      - Before: 12-15 hours/week writing content, one email sequence per client per month, $800/month per client
      - After: first drafts in 20-30 minutes, 2-3 sequences + social content + ad copy monthly, $1,400/month per client
      - System: ContentKit prompt templates — pick category, fill variables, generate options, refine best one
      - Result: 70% time reduction, 75% rate increase
  - **Prompt 5: Welcome Email — Final Offer (Day 9)** — reference prompt EM-10
    - Brief structure: Acknowledge this is the last email in the sequence. Make the honest case without hype. Restate what the product includes. Include pricing for all tiers. Add a guarantee if applicable. Close with a clear CTA and personal sign-off.
    - Variables: [PRODUCT NAME], [PRODUCT SUMMARY], [STARTER PRICE], [FULL PRICE], [GUARANTEE], [CTA LINK]
    - Reference the Day 9 nurture email structure (Email 5) — note the line "This is the last email I'll send about ContentKit AI. If you've been on the fence, here's the honest case"
- Include: Full copy-paste prompts for Prompt 1 (Lead Magnet Delivery) and Prompt 2 (Value/Credibility). Summary table of the 5-email sequence with day, job, and prompt reference.

### H2: AI Prompts for Nurture Email Campaigns (400-500 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - Nurture emails are the long game — they build trust, demonstrate expertise, and keep the sender top-of-mind between purchase opportunities. Most businesses do not send enough of them.
  - **Prompt 6: Nurture Email — Teach One Concept** — reference prompt EM-14
    - Full copy-paste prompt:
      - Role: "Act as a content-focused email writer who educates subscribers by teaching one specific concept per email"
      - Structure: Subject line that creates curiosity. Open with a question or scenario the reader recognizes. Teach one concept with a concrete example. End with a subtle tie-back to the sender's product/service (1 sentence, not a full pitch).
      - Output: 200-300 words. Conversational, first-person tone. No bullet lists — write in paragraphs. One clear takeaway.
      - Variables: [CONCEPT TO TEACH], [RELATABLE SCENARIO], [CONCRETE EXAMPLE], [PRODUCT TIE-IN — 1 sentence]
  - **Prompt 7: Nurture Email — Curated Resources** — reference prompt EM-17
    - Brief structure: Share 3-5 resources (articles, tools, templates) the reader would find valuable. Brief 1-2 sentence description for each. Position the sender as a curator, not a seller.
    - Variables: [THEME], [RESOURCE 1-5 with descriptions], [BRAND NAME]
  - **Prompt 8: Nurture Email — Behind-the-Scenes / Process Reveal** — reference prompt EM-20
    - Brief structure: Share how you built something, how you solved a problem, or how your product works internally. Transparency builds trust. 250-350 words.
    - Variables: [PROCESS/STORY], [KEY INSIGHT FOR THE READER], [BRAND NAME]
  - **Prompt 9: Nurture Email — Myth-Busting** — reference prompt EM-23
    - Brief structure: Identify a common misconception in the industry. State the myth. Explain why people believe it. Reveal the truth with evidence. Apply it to the reader's situation.
    - Variables: [MYTH], [WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT], [THE TRUTH], [APPLICATION]
  - Frequency guidance: Send 1-2 nurture emails per week between promotional campaigns. The ratio should be approximately 3:1 (value emails to sales emails) to maintain list health and engagement.
- Include: Full copy-paste prompt for Prompt 6 (Teach One Concept) with an example output
- Internal link opportunity: Link to Blog Post 02 (ChatGPT Marketing Templates)

### H2: AI Prompts for Sales & Promotional Emails (400-500 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - Sales emails are where the revenue happens — but they also have the highest unsubscribe risk. The prompt engineering matters most here because the line between persuasive and pushy is narrow.
  - **Prompt 10: Sales Email — Product Launch ("What's Inside")** — reference prompt EM-16
    - Full copy-paste prompt from lead magnet Prompt #5
    - Structure: subject-line-to-email callback opening, plain-language product description, 3-4 "what's inside" bullets with context, urgency block (limited time/bonus/early-bird), single CTA. 200-300 words. No hype, no exclamation points.
    - Variables: [PRODUCT NAME], [PRODUCT DESCRIPTION], [PRICE], [MAIN BENEFIT], [BONUS OFFER], [CTA LINK]
    - Full example output: The Social Media Template Pack launch email from the lead magnet
  - **Prompt 11: Sales Email — Urgency/Scarcity Close** — reference prompt EM-30
    - Brief structure: This is the "last chance" email. Acknowledge it directly ("This is the last email about [PRODUCT]"). State the deadline. Restate what they get. Include pricing for all tiers. Add the guarantee. Single CTA.
    - Variables: [PRODUCT NAME], [DEADLINE], [PRODUCT SUMMARY], [PRICING TIERS], [GUARANTEE], [CTA LINK]
    - Reference the Day 9 nurture email (Email 5) structure — note the "compounding inefficiency" framing and the exhaustive product list format
  - **Prompt 12: Sales Email — Objection Handler** — reference prompt EM-33
    - Brief structure: Address the top 3 objections for the product directly. For each: state the objection, validate it, then counter with evidence (data, testimonials, or logic). Close with CTA. Tone: empathetic, not defensive.
    - Variables: [PRODUCT NAME], [OBJECTION 1-3], [COUNTER-EVIDENCE 1-3], [CTA LINK]
  - **Prompt 13: Email Subject Line Generator (10 Angles)** — reference prompt EM-03
    - Full copy-paste prompt from lead magnet Prompt #2
    - 10 angles: Curiosity Gap, Urgency/Scarcity, Social Proof, Benefit-Led, Personalization Hook, Direct Question, How To, Numbered List, FOMO, Humor/Unexpected
    - All under 50 characters
    - Variables: [OFFER DESCRIPTION], [TARGET AUDIENCE], [EMAIL GOAL]
    - Full example output: The 10 Black Friday sale subject lines from the lead magnet
  - Tip: Always generate subject lines FIRST (Prompt 13), pick the best one, then feed it into the body email prompt as context. This creates a cohesive email where the subject line promise matches the body delivery.
- Include: Full copy-paste prompts for Prompt 10 (Launch Email) and Prompt 13 (Subject Line Generator) with example outputs
- Internal link opportunity: Link to Blog Post 03 (AI Copywriting Prompts Free) for ad and landing page prompts that support the sales email campaign

### H2: How Marcus Built a Complete Email System with AI Prompts (300-400 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - Full Marcus case study in the email context (expanded from nurture Email 4):
    - **Who Marcus is:** Freelance marketing consultant managing content and campaigns for 8 clients simultaneously
    - **The email bottleneck:** Before ContentKit, email was his biggest time drain. Writing one email sequence per client took 3-4 hours (research, outline, draft, edit). With 8 clients, that was 24-32 hours per month on email alone — and he could only deliver one sequence per client.
    - **The system he built with ContentKit prompts:**
      1. Start with the Subject Line Generator (EM-03) — generate 10 subject lines per email, pick the top 2 for A/B testing
      2. Use the sequence-specific prompts (EM-01 through EM-10 for welcome, EM-14/EM-17/EM-20/EM-23 for nurture, EM-16/EM-30/EM-33 for sales) — fill in client variables, generate first drafts
      3. Refine with follow-up prompts: "Match this brand voice guide: [paste guide]," "Make the CTA more specific," "Shorten to under 200 words"
      4. Edit the final 20% — add client-specific data, anecdotes, and compliance requirements
    - **The results:**
      - Before: 1 email sequence per client per month, 12-15 hours/week total writing time, $800/month per client
      - After: 2-3 email sequences per client per month + social content + ad copy, first drafts in 20-30 minutes, $1,400/month per client
      - "The shift wasn't his skill — it was his system." (direct quote from the nurture email)
    - **The math:** 70% time reduction on content production, 75% rate increase ($800 to $1,400), same 8 clients = revenue from $6,400/month to $11,200/month
- Include: Before/after metrics in a clear visual format
- Internal link opportunity: Link to ContentKit product page

### H2: FAQ — AI Email Marketing Prompts (300-400 words)
- **Q: How many emails should be in a welcome sequence?**
  A: 3-5 emails over 7-10 days is the standard for most businesses. Email 1 delivers the lead magnet. Emails 2-3 provide value and build credibility. Email 4 introduces the product with social proof. Email 5 makes the final offer. The 5 welcome sequence prompts in this article follow this exact structure.
- **Q: Can AI write entire email sequences, or just individual emails?**
  A: AI writes individual emails best. To build a sequence, use one prompt per email and feed in the context from previous emails to maintain consistency. The prompt-chaining approach (subject line first, then body copy) produces more cohesive results than asking AI to write an entire 5-email sequence at once.
- **Q: Will my emails sound robotic if I use AI prompts?**
  A: Only if the prompt is generic. The prompts in this article include role assignments ("Act as a direct-response email copywriter who writes in a conversational, first-person tone") and tone parameters that prevent the default corporate AI voice. Always edit the output to inject your personal voice — specific phrases, anecdotes, and opinions that are uniquely yours.
- **Q: What email metrics should I expect from AI-written emails?**
  A: Email performance depends on list quality, audience, and offer — not just copy. But well-prompted AI copy typically produces open rates and click rates comparable to professionally written emails. The Subject Line Generator prompt (EM-03) is specifically designed to optimize for open rates by using 10 proven copywriting angles.
- **Q: How do these prompts handle personalization and merge tags?**
  A: The prompts generate the copy structure. You add personalization merge tags (like {{subscriber.first_name}}) during the editing step. Some prompts include placeholder notes for where personalization should go. For advanced personalization (dynamic content blocks, behavioral triggers), you will need to configure those in your email platform.

### Conclusion (150-200 words)
- Summary: AI email marketing prompts cover the three sequence types every business needs — welcome (5 prompts), nurture (4 prompts), and sales (4 prompts). Each prompt is built on a proven email framework with role assignments, structural templates, and variable inputs that produce emails worth sending.
- The efficiency argument: "A freelance email copywriter charges $150-$300 per email. A 5-email welcome sequence runs $750-$1,500. These prompts produce first drafts for an entire sequence in under an hour."
- The Marcus proof point: "Marcus went from one email sequence per client per month to 2-3 sequences, while cutting his total content time by 70% and raising his client rates from $800 to $1,400/month."
- **Product CTA placement:**
- "ContentKit AI includes 65+ email-specific prompts — plus 500+ total prompts across Ads, Social Media, Landing Pages, SEO, Brand Strategy, Product Launch, and Video Scripts. Plus 4 Notion templates including a Campaign Planner to organize your email workflows."
