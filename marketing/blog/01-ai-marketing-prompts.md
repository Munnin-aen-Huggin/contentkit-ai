## Article Outline

### Introduction (200-300 words)
- Hook: "The average marketer spends 6.3 hours per week writing content from scratch. What if you could cut that to 90 minutes with the right AI marketing prompts?"
- Problem: Most marketers know AI can help with content, but when they sit down with ChatGPT or Claude, they get generic, unusable output. The issue is not the tool — it is the prompt. Vague inputs produce vague copy. Marketers end up spending more time editing AI garbage than they would have spent writing from scratch.
- Promise: This article delivers 50+ copy-paste AI marketing prompts organized by channel — ads, emails, social media, landing pages, and more. Each prompt is engineered with role assignments, tone parameters, audience specificity, and output formatting so you get usable first drafts, not filler.
- Keyword placement: "ai marketing prompts" appears in the opening sentence of paragraph 2 ("If you've searched for ai marketing prompts before, you've probably found lists of generic one-liners...")
- Mention the Marcus case study early: "One freelance marketing consultant used structured AI prompts to cut content production time by 70% and raise his rates from $800 to $1,400/month per client."

### H2: Why Most AI Marketing Prompts Fail (300-400 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - The "garbage in, garbage out" problem — generic prompts like "write me a Facebook ad" produce generic copy
  - What separates a bad prompt from a production-ready prompt: role assignment, audience specificity, framework selection, tone parameters, output format constraints
  - Example comparison: a bad prompt vs. a structured prompt for the same task (reference the email subject line example from the lead magnet — show the "write me a subject line" vs. the 50-word engineered prompt from Email 2 of the nurture sequence)
  - The concept of "character briefs" for AI — giving the AI a persona, constraints, and context before asking it to produce
- Include: Side-by-side comparison table showing a generic prompt vs. an engineered prompt and the difference in output quality
- Internal link opportunity: Link to Blog Post 03 (AI Copywriting Prompts Free) when mentioning ad and email examples

### H2: How to Get the Most Out of AI Marketing Prompts (300 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - Tip 1: Variable specificity matters — "freelancers aged 25-40 who struggle with pricing" beats "freelancers" every time. The more specific your variable inputs, the more targeted the output.
  - Tip 2: Follow-up prompting technique — after the first output, use refinement prompts like "Make the tone more urgent" or "Rewrite the headline using a curiosity gap angle." AI output improves dramatically on the second pass.
  - Tip 3: Chain prompts for complete campaigns — use one prompt to generate ad copy, feed the winning angle into an email prompt, then use the same positioning in a landing page prompt. Consistency across channels.
  - Tip 4: Always edit the output — AI gives you an 80% first draft. The last 20% (your brand voice, specific data points, personal stories) is what makes it yours.
  - Reference Marcus's system: "Pick the right category, fill in the client variables, generate multiple options, refine the best one."

### H2: FAQ — AI Marketing Prompts (300-400 words)
- **Q: Do AI marketing prompts work with any AI tool?**
  A: Yes. Every prompt in this article (and in ContentKit AI) works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and any LLM-based writing tool. The prompt structure is model-agnostic.
- **Q: Are AI marketing prompts just for small businesses?**
  A: No. Solopreneurs, freelancers, agency owners, and in-house marketing teams all use structured prompts. The difference is scale — a freelancer uses them for client deliverables; an agency uses them to systemize output across accounts.
- **Q: How are these different from free ChatGPT prompts I find online?**
  A: Most free prompt lists give you one-line instructions ("write a Facebook ad"). These prompts include role assignments, framework selection, tone parameters, audience specificity, and output format constraints — the elements that make AI output actually usable.
- **Q: Can AI prompts replace a copywriter entirely?**
  A: AI prompts produce roughly 80% of a professional copywriter's output. You still need human judgment for brand voice, factual accuracy, and strategic context. But for first drafts, variations, and high-volume content, prompts eliminate the blank-page problem.
- **Q: How many prompts do I actually need?**
  A: For a single channel (e.g., email only), 10-15 well-structured prompts cover most use cases. For multi-channel marketing, you need 50+ across categories. ContentKit includes 500+ organized across 8 categories.
