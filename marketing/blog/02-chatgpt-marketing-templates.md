## Article Outline

### Introduction (200-300 words)
- Hook: "ChatGPT can write marketing copy. But without the right template, it writes the kind of copy you would never actually publish — generic openers, hollow benefit statements, and CTAs that sound like they came from a 2009 landing page."
- Problem: Marketers are sitting on the most powerful writing tool ever created but using it like a search engine. They type "write me a marketing email" and get output that requires more editing than writing from scratch would have taken. The tool is not the bottleneck — the template is.
- Promise: This article provides ready-to-use ChatGPT marketing templates for every major channel — Facebook ads, email sequences, Instagram captions, landing pages, and more. Each template includes the role assignment, framework, constraints, and variables that make ChatGPT produce professional-grade output on the first pass.
- Keyword placement: "chatgpt marketing templates" appears naturally in paragraph 2 ("The real power of chatgpt marketing templates is not the AI — it is the structure you give it.")
- Brief mention of results: "A freelance consultant named Marcus used structured ChatGPT templates to handle 8 clients simultaneously, cutting content production time by 70%."

### H2: What Makes a ChatGPT Marketing Template Actually Work (300-400 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - The anatomy of a high-performing ChatGPT prompt for marketing — 5 essential components:
    1. **Role assignment:** "Act as a [specific type of copywriter/strategist]" — tells ChatGPT what expertise to simulate
    2. **Framework selection:** PAS, AIDA, Before-After-Bridge, "What's Inside" — gives the output a proven structure
    3. **Audience specificity:** Not "small business owners" but "freelance designers aged 28-40 who charge under $5K per project"
    4. **Output constraints:** Word count, character limits, number of variations, formatting requirements
    5. **Variables:** Bracketed placeholders like [PRODUCT NAME], [TARGET AUDIENCE], [PAIN POINT] that you swap for your specifics
  - Why this matters: a prompt with all 5 elements produces output that is 80% ready to publish. A prompt without them produces output that is 80% ready to delete.
  - Reference the nurture email (Email 2, Day 2) comparison: the vague "write me an email subject line" vs. the engineered prompt with role, audience, angle, and tone constraints
- Include: A visual breakdown or formatted example showing each of the 5 components labeled in a real prompt

### H2: ChatGPT Templates for Email Campaigns (400-500 words)

### H2: ChatGPT Templates for Landing Pages (300-400 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - Landing page copy is high-stakes — one page, one goal, and the copy either converts or it does not. ChatGPT templates need to enforce conversion principles, not just generate words.
  - **Template 1: Hero Section Generator** — reference prompt LP-01
    - Full template from lead magnet Prompt #4: headline (outcome-focused, under 12 words), subheadline (who + differentiator, under 30 words), 3 benefit bullets (bolded micro-benefit + explanatory sentence), CTA button (action-oriented, under 5 words)

### H2: How Marcus Used ChatGPT Marketing Templates to 2x His Client Revenue (300-400 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - Full Marcus case study expansion (from nurture Email 4):
    - Context: Marcus is a freelance marketing consultant managing 8 clients simultaneously
    - Before: 12-15 hours/week writing client content, one email sequence per client per month at best, charging $800/month per client
    - The system he built: Pick the right ContentKit category, fill in client-specific variables, generate multiple options, refine the best one
    - After: First drafts in 20-30 minutes using prompt templates, delivers 2-3 email sequences + full month of social content + ad copy variations per client per month, raised rates to $1,400/month per client
    - The math: 70% time reduction, 75% rate increase ($800 to $1,400), same 8 clients = went from $6,400/month to $11,200/month in revenue
  - The lesson: the difference was not skill, it was system. Structured templates turned ChatGPT from a toy into a production tool.

### H2: FAQ — ChatGPT Marketing Templates (300-400 words)
- **Q: Do these ChatGPT marketing templates work with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and GPT-3.5?**
  A: Yes. The templates are engineered around prompt structure, not model-specific features. They produce strong output on GPT-4, GPT-4o, and GPT-3.5 — though GPT-4+ tends to follow complex instructions more precisely. They also work identically in Claude, Gemini, and other LLMs.
- **Q: Can I use these templates for client work?**
  A: Absolutely. Marcus (the case study in this article) uses ContentKit templates for all 8 of his marketing clients. The templates are designed to be customized with client-specific variables — product name, audience, tone, goals — so the output is unique to each business.
- **Q: How are these different from ChatGPT's built-in marketing features?**
  A: ChatGPT's default behavior when asked for marketing copy is to produce generic output based on broad patterns. These templates override that default by specifying a role, framework, audience, constraints, and output format. The difference is comparable to giving a contractor a rough sketch vs. detailed blueprints.
- **Q: How often should I update my ChatGPT marketing templates?**
  A: The prompt structures remain effective long-term because they are based on copywriting fundamentals (PAS, AIDA, etc.), not AI-specific tricks. Update your variables (audience data, product details, offers) regularly. ContentKit includes lifetime updates.
- **Q: What if the output is not perfect on the first try?**
  A: It rarely is — and that is by design. AI gives you an 80% first draft. Use follow-up prompts to refine: "Make the tone more conversational," "Shorten the headline," "Add more urgency to the CTA." The first output is a starting point, not a final draft.

### Conclusion (150-200 words)
- Summary: ChatGPT marketing templates are the difference between AI as a gimmick and AI as a production system. The templates in this article cover ads, email, social media, and landing pages — each with the role assignment, framework, and variable structure that makes ChatGPT output actually usable.
- The results are real: Marcus went from 12-15 hours/week on content to under 5, and raised his rates by 75% because his output quality improved with a structured system.
- **Product CTA placement:**
- "ContentKit AI includes 500+ templates like these across 8 marketing categories: Ads, Emails, Social Media, Landing Pages, SEO, Brand Strategy, Product Launch, and Video Scripts. Plus 4 Notion templates to organize your content workflow."
