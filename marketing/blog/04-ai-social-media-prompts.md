## Article Outline

### Introduction (200-300 words)
- Hook: "The average social media manager publishes 20-30 posts per month across platforms. At 30-45 minutes per post — research, writing, editing, formatting — that is 10-22 hours per month on content creation alone. What if you could compress that into a single afternoon?"
- Problem: Social media content is a volume game. You need fresh posts daily across Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and TikTok — each platform with different formats, tones, and audience expectations. Most marketers either burn out trying to keep up, or they batch-create mediocre content that gets zero engagement. AI can help, but "write me a LinkedIn post" produces the kind of corporate fluff that gets scrolled past.
- Promise: This article gives you AI social media prompts for every major platform — structured templates that produce scroll-stopping content, not generic filler. Plus a batch workflow to write 30 days of cross-platform content in one sitting.
- Keyword placement: "ai social media prompts" in the second paragraph ("The right ai social media prompts do not just save time — they produce content that sounds like it was written by someone who understands each platform.")
- Proof point: "One ContentKit user, Marcus, produces a full month of social content for 8 clients in a fraction of the time it used to take — part of a system that cut his content production by 70%."

### H2: Why Generic AI Social Media Prompts Produce Generic Content (300-400 words)
- Key points to cover:
  - The platform problem: Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and TikTok each reward different content formats, lengths, and tones. A prompt that works for LinkedIn thought leadership produces terrible Instagram captions.
  - The specificity gap: "Write me an Instagram caption about my product" gives the AI nothing to work with — no audience, no hook type, no tone parameters, no length constraints. The output is predictably bland.
  - What makes a social media prompt work:
    1. **Platform-specific role:** "Act as an Instagram growth copywriter" vs. "Act as a B2B LinkedIn content strategist" — different roles produce fundamentally different outputs
    2. **Hook type specification:** Telling the AI to use a "Bold Statement" hook vs. a "Story Opener" vs. a "Controversial Take" produces wildly different opening lines
    3. **Audience granularity:** "[TARGET AUDIENCE]: freelance designers aged 28-40 who charge under $5K per project and want to raise their rates" vs. "[TARGET AUDIENCE]: freelancers"
    4. **Output constraints:** "1-2 sentences maximum" for a hook, "150-200 words" for a LinkedIn post, "under 60 seconds spoken" for a TikTok script
  - The principle: the more constraints you give the AI, the more creative and usable the output becomes (this is counterintuitive but consistently true)
- Include: A side-by-side comparison of a generic prompt vs. a structured prompt for Instagram, with the drastically different outputs

### H2: AI Instagram Prompts — Captions, Hooks & Carousels (400-500 words)

### H2: AI LinkedIn Prompts — Thought Leadership & B2B Content (400-500 words)

### H2: AI Twitter/X Prompts — Threads, Hooks & Engagement (400-500 words)

### H2: FAQ — AI Social Media Prompts (300-400 words)
- **Q: Can AI social media prompts create platform-specific content?**
  A: Yes — but only if the prompt specifies the platform. A prompt with "Act as an Instagram growth copywriter" produces different output than "Act as a B2B LinkedIn content strategist." The prompts in this article are pre-configured for each platform's format, tone, and length requirements.
- **Q: Will my content sound like everyone else's if I use AI prompts?**
  A: Only if you skip the customization step. The output quality depends entirely on the variables you input — your specific audience, product, pain points, and brand voice. Two businesses using the same prompt with different variables will get completely different content. Always edit the final 20% to add your personal voice and specific details.
- **Q: How many social media posts per month should I publish?**
  A: Platform-dependent. A strong baseline: Instagram 4-5x/week, LinkedIn 3-4x/week, Twitter/X 5-7x/week, TikTok 3-5x/week. That is 60-84 posts per month. The batch workflow in this article produces 32 high-quality pieces — enough for a strong presence on 4 platforms without burnout.
- **Q: Do these prompts handle hashtags and formatting?**
  A: The prompts focus on the copy itself. For hashtags, use a separate prompt (or ContentKit prompt SM-48: Hashtag Research Generator) that produces platform-specific hashtag sets based on your niche and content type.
- **Q: Can I use one prompt across multiple platforms?**
  A: Not recommended. Each platform has different optimal lengths, tones, and formats. The Video-to-Text Repurposer prompt (SM-45) is specifically designed for cross-platform adaptation — it takes content from one format and restructures it for another platform's requirements.

### Conclusion (150-200 words)
- Summary: AI social media prompts turn content creation from a daily grind into a batch workflow.

With the batch workflow, you can produce 30 days of cross-platform content in one afternoon.
- The Marcus proof point: "Marcus uses this system to produce a full month of social content for each of his 8 clients — part of a workflow that cut his content production time by 70% and allowed him to raise rates from $800 to $1,400/month per client."
