# Reddit Batch 1 -- Ready-to-Post Reference

**Last updated:** 2026-02-27

---

## Rules & Reminders

1. **No self-promotion in seed comments.** Seed comments exist solely to build karma and credibility. Zero links, zero mentions of your product, zero hints.
2. **Build karma first.** Post all seed comments (Days 1-3 per subreddit) BEFORE posting your resource post. Reddit communities (and moderators) notice when an account shows up only to promote.
3. **Find real threads that match the topic.** Each seed comment below includes a topic to search for. Sort the subreddit by "New" or "Hot," find a thread that fits, and adapt the comment to match the specific post. Do NOT create your own thread for seed comments -- you are replying to existing discussions.
4. **One comment per day, per subreddit.** Space them out. Do not dump all comments on the same day.
5. **Read the thread before posting.** Make sure your comment adds something the other replies have not already said. Adjust the wording if needed so it reads as a natural response, not a pre-written script.
6. **Resource posts go up AFTER seed comments.** Only post the resource thread once you have established a presence in that subreddit.
7. **Google Doc URLs must be inserted.** Each resource post has a placeholder (e.g., `[GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_FREELANCE]`). Replace it with the actual shareable link before posting.

## Suggested Schedule

| Day | r/freelance | r/smallbusiness | r/marketing | r/Entrepreneur |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1   | Seed #1     | Seed #1         | Seed #1     | Seed #1        |
| 2   | Seed #2     | Seed #2         | Seed #2     | Seed #2        |
| 3   | Seed #3     | Seed #3         | Seed #3     | Seed #3        |
| 4   | Resource Post | Resource Post | Resource Post | Resource Post |

Space out subreddits if needed (e.g., do r/freelance and r/smallbusiness in the morning, r/marketing and r/Entrepreneur in the afternoon). The key is that each subreddit sees at least 3 genuine, helpful comments from your account before you post the resource thread.

### Day 1 -- Seed Comment #1

**Find a post about:** Scope creep / handling clients who keep adding to the project

**Comment to post:**

> The biggest shift I made was moving from hourly billing to project-based pricing with a clearly defined scope document. Not a contract addendum -- an actual one-page scope doc that lists exactly what's included, how many revisions, and what counts as "out of scope."
>
> When a client asks for something extra, I don't say no. I say: "Absolutely, I can do that. Here's what that adds to the project." Then I send a quick one-line change order with the additional cost. Most of the time, they either say yes (and you get paid fairly) or they realize it wasn't that important.
>
> The key is framing it as professionalism, not pushback. Clients respect freelancers who have a process. The ones who don't respect it are clients you don't want anyway. I lost maybe two clients early on by holding this boundary, but the ones who stayed became my best long-term accounts because they saw me as a professional, not a vending machine.
>
> Start with the scope doc on your next project and see how it changes the dynamic.

---

### Day 2 -- Seed Comment #2

**Find a post about:** Finding clients outside of Upwork / where to get freelance work

**Comment to post:**

> Upwork is fine for getting started, but the real leverage is in channels where you're not competing with 200 other proposals. Three things that consistently work:
>
> First, LinkedIn content. Not cold DMs -- actual posts where you share what you know. Even once a week. It positions you as someone who understands the work, and inbound leads from LinkedIn close at a much higher rate than marketplace bids.
>
> Second, niche communities. If you're a copywriter for SaaS companies, go where SaaS founders hang out -- specific Slack groups, subreddits, indie hacker forums. Answer questions genuinely. People notice.
>
> Third, past clients. Most freelancers never ask for referrals. A simple email 2-3 weeks after project delivery -- "Know anyone who might need similar work?" -- has generated more business for me than any platform.
>
> The pattern is the same: be visible where your ideal clients already are, and lead with value instead of a pitch. It takes longer to build than a marketplace profile, but the quality of work and rates are in a different league.

---

### Day 3 -- Seed Comment #3

**Find a post about:** Writing proposals / winning projects / improving proposal close rate

**Comment to post:**

> I used to spend 2-3 hours per proposal and close maybe 10-15% of them. Now I spend 30-45 minutes and close around 50%. The difference wasn't writing more -- it was restructuring what I wrote.
>
> The structure that works: start with their problem (not your credentials), show you understand their specific situation, outline the approach in 3-4 clear steps, include one specific result from similar past work, and make the pricing section dead simple -- no line items, just the outcome they're buying and the investment.
>
> Two things most freelancers get wrong: they lead with "About Me" (the client doesn't care yet), and they present 3 pricing tiers when the client just wants to know what the right option costs. One price, one scope, one clear next step.
>
> Also -- and this sounds counterintuitive -- shorter proposals win more often. A one-page proposal that nails their problem beats a five-page document that covers everything. Decision fatigue kills deals. Make it easy to say yes.

### Day 4 -- Resource Post

**Post as a NEW thread in r/freelance**

**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for freelancers who spend too much time writing client deliverables

**Body:**

> I've been freelancing for a while now, and one thing that always ate into my margins was the sheer volume of writing that goes into client work -- proposals, emails, social media captions, ad copy, landing pages, blog outlines. The actual strategy and creative direction is the valuable part, but the first-draft production was taking up half my week.
>
> About six months ago I started building a library of structured AI prompts for every type of deliverable I was producing. Not generic "write me a blog post" prompts -- prompts with specific frameworks, roles, word counts, and variables you fill in per client. The difference in output quality was night and day compared to what most people get from ChatGPT.
>
> I pulled 15 of the most useful ones into a free guide specifically for freelancers doing client work. Here's what's inside:
>
> - **Cold outreach + follow-up sequences** -- for landing new clients or writing outreach for clients
> - **LinkedIn content** -- thought leadership and tactical posts that build your credibility
> - **Landing page copy** -- above-the-fold sections, feature-to-benefit bullets, FAQ sections
> - **Brand strategy** -- positioning statements and ICPs to anchor all your client work
> - **Ad copy** -- Facebook ads (AIDA + benefit-driven), Google responsive search ad headlines
> - **SEO** -- blog post outlines with keyword targeting and heading hierarchy
> - **Video scripts** -- YouTube tutorial scripts for client content production
> - **Social media** -- Instagram captions that actually drive engagement
>
> Each prompt is copy-paste ready with customizable variables. I use these daily across multiple client accounts and they've probably saved me 10-12 hours a week on first drafts alone.
>
> Here's the Google Doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_FREELANCE]
>
> No email gate, no signup. Just the prompts.
>
> If you try any of them, I'd genuinely like to hear which ones you found most useful. Happy to answer questions about how I use them in my workflow.

**NOTE:** Replace `[GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_FREELANCE]` with the actual Google Doc share link before posting.

### Day 1 -- Seed Comment #1

**Find a post about:** Facebook ads not working / wasting money on ads / should I stop running ads

**Comment to post:**

> Before you stop, diagnose the problem. $500/month is enough to get results if it is targeted correctly, but most small business owners make the same three mistakes.
>
> First, check your audience. If you are running interest-based targeting to cold audiences, you are paying Facebook to guess who your customers are. Instead, upload your customer email list (even if it is just 100 people) and create a lookalike audience. Facebook will find people who resemble your actual buyers.
>
> Second, look at your ad copy. If your ad describes what your product does instead of what problem it solves, people will scroll past. Lead with the pain point. "Tired of waiting 3 weeks for a plumber?" works better than "We offer residential plumbing services."
>
> Third, check your landing page. If your ad sends people to your homepage instead of a page specifically about the thing the ad promised, your conversion rate will be near zero. The ad and the landing page need to tell the same story.
>
> Try fixing these three things before turning off the budget entirely. $500 is workable -- the targeting and messaging just need to match.

---

### Day 2 -- Seed Comment #2

**Find a post about:** Marketing with no budget / free marketing strategies / zero-budget promotion

**Comment to post:**

> The honest answer is that you trade time for money. But the key is choosing the right time investments, because most free marketing activities have terrible returns.
>
> Here is what actually works at zero budget. First, get your Google Business Profile completely filled out -- photos, services, hours, and a description with your location and service type. This is free and it is how most local customers find you. Ask your top five customers for a Google review this week. Five genuine reviews with responses from you will outperform months of social media posting.
>
> Second, pick one social platform where your customers actually spend time. Not all of them -- one. Post three times a week with content that helps your audience, not content that promotes your business. If you are a landscaper, post seasonal lawn care tips. If you are an accountant, post tax deadline reminders. Helpful content builds trust before someone ever needs to hire you.
>
> Third, start an email list even if it is just a spreadsheet. Every customer and lead goes on it. A monthly email to 50 real contacts will outperform 1,000 Instagram followers who will never buy.

---

### Day 3 -- Seed Comment #3

**Find a post about:** Do I need a website / social media vs website / is a website worth it

**Comment to post:**

> You need a website, and it does not need to cost more than $200 to start. Here is why social media alone is a risk.
>
> You do not own your social media audience. If Facebook changes its algorithm tomorrow (and it will), your organic reach drops to near zero overnight. This has happened multiple times. Businesses that built entirely on Facebook Pages in 2015 lost almost all their organic reach by 2018.
>
> A website gives you three things social media cannot. First, you own the SEO traffic. When someone Googles "plumber near me" or "best cupcakes in [your city]," your website can show up. Your Instagram page cannot. Second, you control the experience. Your website has one job -- getting the visitor to call you, book online, or buy. Social media has a thousand distractions competing for attention. Third, you own the email list. A simple lead capture form on your website builds an asset that no platform change can take away from you.
>
> Start with a one-page site: what you do, who you serve, proof it works (reviews), and how to contact you. You can build this on Carrd for $19 per year or on Squarespace for $16 per month. Add social media on top of that foundation, not instead of it.

### Day 4 -- Resource Post

**Post as a NEW thread in r/smallbusiness**

**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for small business owners who do all their own marketing

**Body:**

> I know the drill. You run the business, answer the phones, manage the team, AND somehow you are also supposed to write Facebook ads, post on Instagram, send emails, and figure out SEO. Hiring a marketing agency costs $2,000-5,000 per month. Hiring even a freelance copywriter is $150+ per project.
>
> So I built something for the DIY marketer. It is a free Google Doc with 12 AI prompts you can paste into ChatGPT or Claude to handle the marketing tasks that normally take hours.
>
> These are not generic prompts like "write me a social media post." Each one is engineered with a specific framework, a defined role for the AI, and variables you fill in with your business details. The output is something you can actually use -- not something you have to rewrite from scratch.
>
> Here is what the 12 prompts cover:
>
> - **Facebook ads** -- lead generation ads and community engagement posts
> - **Instagram** -- product feature captions and 30-second Reel/TikTok scripts
> - **Email** -- weekly newsletter format and lead magnet delivery
> - **Website** -- above-the-fold homepage copy and lead magnet landing pages
> - **Local SEO** -- Google Business Profile descriptions and how-to blog guides
> - **Google ads** -- Shopping ad descriptions
> - **Social media** -- launch day posts across 5 platforms simultaneously
> - **Business** -- elevator pitches in 15, 30, and 60-second versions
>
> Every prompt includes when to use it, the exact text to copy-paste, and the variables to swap in for your specific business.
>
> Here is the doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_SMALLBUSINESS]
>
> No email required. No signup. Just the prompts.
>
> I built these because I watched too many small business owners either overpay for mediocre marketing help or give up on marketing entirely. You do not need a marketing team -- you just need better tools. Let me know which prompts work best for your business.

**NOTE:** Replace `[GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_SMALLBUSINESS]` with the actual Google Doc share link before posting.

### Day 1 -- Seed Comment #1

**Find a post about:** Content calendars / organizing content for a small team / content planning

**Comment to post:**

> The biggest mistake I see small marketing teams make with content calendars is trying to fill every slot across every platform. You end up with a beautiful spreadsheet and exhausted people producing mediocre content.
>
> What works better is the pillar content model. Pick one long-form piece per week -- a blog post, a YouTube video, or a newsletter issue. That becomes your pillar. Then break it into derivative pieces: pull 3-4 social posts from it, turn a section into an email, clip a quote for LinkedIn.
>
> This way your team produces one great thing instead of fifteen okay things. The content stays consistent in messaging because it all comes from the same source. And if someone is out sick, you only miss one pillar instead of scrambling to fill twelve platform-specific content slots.
>
> Start with one pillar per week for a month. Track what gets engagement. Then decide whether to scale up the volume or double down on what is working.

### Day 2 -- Seed Comment #2

**Find a post about:** Facebook ads getting clicks but no conversions / ad copy optimization / ads not converting

**Comment to post:**

> Clicks without conversions usually means one of two things: your targeting is too broad, or your ad copy is attracting the wrong people.
>
> Here is a diagnostic framework I use. First, check your click-through rate versus your landing page conversion rate. If CTR is high but landing page conversions are low, your ad is making a promise your landing page does not deliver on. That is a messaging alignment issue, not an ad issue.
>
> Second, look at who is clicking. If you are running interest-based targeting, try narrowing to lookalike audiences based on actual buyers, not just page visitors. Page visitors include a lot of tire-kickers.
>
> Third, check your ad copy structure. The most reliable framework for cold traffic is PAS -- Problem, Agitate, Solve. Open with a specific pain your audience recognizes, spend a sentence or two on why that pain is worse than they think, then position your product as the fix. People who click on a PAS ad are pre-qualified because the pain point filtered out everyone else.

### Day 3 -- Seed Comment #3

**Find a post about:** AI for marketing / is AI useful for content / ChatGPT for marketing

**Comment to post:**

> Both, depending entirely on how you use it. The default experience most marketers have is typing something like "write me an email for my product launch" and getting something that sounds like a college intern's first draft. That is not the AI's fault -- it is a prompt quality problem.
>
> The difference between garbage output and genuinely useful output is structure. When you give AI a specific role (e.g., "act as a direct-response copywriter"), a specific framework (e.g., PAS or AIDA), specific variables about your product and audience, and a specific format constraint (e.g., "under 150 words, include headline and CTA"), the output jumps from a 3 out of 10 to a 7 or 8 out of 10.
>
> You still need to edit. AI is not replacing your marketing judgment. But it eliminates the blank page problem and gives you a solid first draft in minutes instead of hours. The marketers I know who are getting real value from AI treat it like a junior copywriter who needs a detailed brief -- not like a magic button.

---

### Day 4 -- Resource Post

**Post as a NEW thread in r/marketing**

**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for marketing teams who waste hours writing copy from scratch

**Body:**

> I spent the last few months building a library of AI marketing prompts -- structured prompts you paste into ChatGPT or Claude that produce actual usable output instead of generic fluff.
>
> The difference between a good AI prompt and a bad one is the same difference between a good creative brief and a vague one. Most people type "write me a Facebook ad" and get something they would never run. But when you give AI a specific copywriting framework (like AIDA or PAS), a defined role, and clear variables about your product and audience, the output goes from unusable to "I can run this after one edit."
>
> I pulled 15 of these prompts into a free Google Doc for marketing teams. It covers:
>
> - **Ads** -- AIDA-framework Facebook ads, before/after transformation ads, Google search ad descriptions
> - **Email** -- welcome sequences, flash sale emails
> - **Social** -- LinkedIn thought leadership posts, Twitter/X educational threads
> - **Landing pages** -- benefit bullets, pricing section copy, closing CTAs
> - **SEO** -- keyword-targeted blog outlines, pillar content structure plans
> - **Brand strategy** -- messaging hierarchy, messaging pillars
> - **Product launch** -- multi-platform launch day posts
> - **Video** -- YouTube hook scripts in 5 variants
>
> Each prompt includes the context for when to use it, the full prompt text you copy-paste, and the variables you swap in for your business.
>
> Here is the doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_MARKETING]
>
> No email gate, no signup, no pitch. Just the prompts.
>
> I built these because I was tired of seeing the same advice -- "just use AI for your marketing" -- without anyone showing the actual prompts that make it work. These are the ones I use daily.
>
> If you grab it, I would genuinely appreciate feedback on which prompts work best and which categories you would want more of. Happy to answer questions in the comments.

**NOTE:** Replace `[GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_MARKETING]` with the actual Google Doc share link before posting.

### Day 1 -- Seed Comment #1

**Find a post about:** Getting first customers / first 100 users / customer acquisition with no budget

**Comment to post:**

> Forget about scale for now. Your first 100 customers are not coming from ads, funnels, or viral content. They are coming from conversations.
>
> Here is the playbook that has worked for multiple bootstrapped products I have seen launch successfully. First, find 10 online communities where your target customer hangs out -- subreddits, Facebook groups, Slack communities, Discord servers, indie hacker forums. Lurk for a week. Learn what they complain about, what they ask for help with, what tools they already use.
>
> Then start helping. Answer questions. Share frameworks. Give specific advice. Do this for two to three weeks before you ever mention your product. When you do mention it, do it in context -- "I actually built something for this exact problem" -- not as a cold pitch.
>
> Second, reach out to 50 people individually. DM them, email them, comment on their posts. Offer early access or a discount in exchange for honest feedback. Your first 100 customers are also your first 100 feedback loops. Their input shapes the product more than any market research ever will.
>
> Paid acquisition comes later. Your first 100 come from hustle and genuine helpfulness.

---

### Day 2 -- Seed Comment #2

**Find a post about:** Validating a product idea / how to know if an idea is worth building / idea validation

**Comment to post:**

> The best validation is someone paying you money. Everything else -- surveys, landing page signups, people saying "I would totally buy that" -- is unreliable.
>
> Here is the fastest validation framework. Step one: write a one-paragraph product description. What it does, who it is for, what the outcome is, and a price. Step two: build a simple landing page with that description, a price, and a "buy now" or "join waitlist" button. You can do this in an afternoon with Carrd or a simple Notion page. Step three: share it in three to five communities where your target customer exists. Not as an ad -- share it as "I am building this and want to know if it solves a real problem."
>
> If people give you their email or pre-order, you have validation. If they say "cool idea" but do not sign up, you do not. The number that matters is not how many people liked your post -- it is how many people took an action that costs them something, even if that something is just their email address.
>
> Do this before writing a single line of code or designing a single screen. A week of validation saves months of building something nobody wants.

---

### Day 3 -- Seed Comment #3

**Find a post about:** Branding for startups / do I need branding early / brand vs product focus

**Comment to post:**

> Branding at the early stage is not about logos, color palettes, or brand guidelines. It is about positioning -- knowing exactly who you are for and why they should pick you over the alternatives.
>
> You need three things before you need a brand designer. First, a one-sentence positioning statement: "For [specific audience], [your product] is the [category] that [does this differently]." This sentence should make half the market say "that is not for me" and the other half say "that is exactly what I need." If it appeals to everyone, it is too vague.
>
> Second, a consistent voice. Pick three adjectives that describe how your brand communicates -- for example, direct, practical, and approachable. Use those as a filter for every piece of copy you write. This costs nothing and takes 30 minutes to decide.
>
> Third, a clear origin story. Why did you build this? What problem did you personally experience? Founders who can answer this in two sentences connect with early adopters faster than any logo ever will.
>
> The visual branding can come later when you have revenue. But the strategic branding -- positioning, voice, and story -- should come before your first launch. It shapes everything from your landing page to your first tweet.

---

### Day 4 -- Resource Post

**Post as a NEW thread in r/Entrepreneur**

**Title:** I made a free prompt kit for bootstrapped founders who handle their own marketing

**Body:**

> When I started building my product, the marketing was the bottleneck. Not the code. Not the design. The marketing.
>
> Writing a landing page took two days. Drafting launch emails took an afternoon. Coming up with social posts for five platforms took another morning. And the worst part was that after all that time, the output was mediocre -- because I am a builder, not a copywriter.
>
> So I started engineering structured AI prompts that produce specific marketing outputs. Not "write me an ad" -- that gives you garbage. I mean prompts with a defined copywriting framework, a specific role for the AI, and clear variables you fill in for your product. The difference in output quality is night and day.
>
> I pulled 12 of the most founder-relevant prompts into a free Google Doc. These are the ones that matter most when you are going from zero to first customers:
>
> - **Pre-launch** -- waitlist landing page copy and Product Hunt launch posts
> - **Launch day** -- multi-platform social posts, launch emails to your list, story-format Facebook ads, and product launch tweets
> - **Brand building** -- positioning statements, brand origin stories, and USP development
> - **Sales** -- long-form sales page outlines and 7-minute VSL scripts
> - **Paid acquisition** -- Google Performance Max asset sets
>
> Each prompt includes context for when to use it, the full prompt text, and the variables you swap in for your specific product.
>
> Here is the doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_ENTREPRENEUR]
>
> No email gate. No pitch. Just the prompts.
>
> I built these because every bootstrapped founder I know faces the same problem -- you can build the product, but marketing it solo is a completely different skill set. These prompts do not replace marketing thinking, but they eliminate the blank page and give you a strong first draft in minutes.
>
> Would love to hear which prompts are most useful for your stage. Happy to answer questions.

**NOTE:** Replace `[GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_ENTREPRENEUR]` with the actual Google Doc share link before posting.

## Pre-Post Checklist

Before executing this plan, confirm you have:

- [ ] A Reddit account with some baseline activity (not a brand-new account)
- [ ] The 4 Google Doc share links ready to replace the placeholders
- [ ] Bookmarked or searched each subreddit for threads matching the seed comment topics
- [ ] Read each target thread to make sure your comment fits naturally in context
- [ ] Adjusted any specific numbers or examples in seed comments to match the thread you are replying to

## After Posting
