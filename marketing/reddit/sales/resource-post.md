**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for sales teams who waste hours writing cold emails and follow-ups from scratch

**Body:**

I've been building AI-powered marketing and sales tools for a while, and one thing I kept hearing from sales teams was the same complaint: they spend a massive chunk of their week writing -- cold emails, follow-ups, LinkedIn messages, internal pitch decks, sales page copy -- and most of it gets written from scratch every time, even when the structure should be repeatable.

The problem isn't that reps can't write. It's that writing good sales copy from a blank page is a different skill than selling, and most reps don't have a system for it. So they default to the same templates everyone else uses, and their reply rates reflect it.

I put together a free guide with 12 structured AI prompts built specifically for sales professionals. These aren't "write me a cold email" prompts -- each one has a tested framework, specific structure, word count targets, and variables you customize for your product, prospect, and market.

Here's what's inside:

- **Cold outreach** -- B2B prospecting emails that lead with the prospect's problem, not your pitch
- **Follow-up sequences** -- 3-email sequences where every follow-up adds new value
- **LinkedIn InMail** -- cold outreach that reads like a personal message, not a sales blast
- **Nurture emails** -- story-based case study emails and direct final-ask closers
- **Video sales letters** -- 7-minute VSL scripts with full structure and slide notes
- **Sales page architecture** -- complete long-form sales page outlines with psychological section mapping
- **Objection handling copy** -- inline micro-copy for sales pages and pitch decks
- **Retargeting ads** -- Facebook ad copy for warm leads who visited but didn't convert
- **Targeting sections** -- "who is this for / not for" copy that qualifies buyers before the call
- **Re-engagement emails** -- for leads who went cold without a response

Every prompt works with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Copy, paste, fill in the variables, and get usable copy in minutes.

No email required. No signup. Just the prompts.

If you try any of them on your outbound, I'd genuinely like to hear what reply rates you see. Happy to answer questions about how to customize them for specific verticals.
