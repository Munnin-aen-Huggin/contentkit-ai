# 12 AI Prompts That Write Better Sales Copy Than Your Top Rep

**By ContentKit AI** | Free Resource

Your best sales rep knows how to open cold, handle objections, and close. But they can only write so many emails in a day. These 12 AI prompts give every rep on your team the ability to produce professional cold outreach, follow-up sequences, sales pages, video scripts, and objection-handling copy -- in minutes instead of hours. Copy them into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, fill in the variables, and start sending.

## Prompt 1: Cold Outreach Email -- B2B Prospecting (EM-16)

**When to use:** When your team needs to prospect at scale without sending the same generic template to every list. This prompt produces cold emails that lead with the prospect's problem, not your pitch.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a B2B cold email specialist. Write a cold outreach email for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting [TARGET COMPANY TYPE -- e.g., "marketing agencies with 5-15 employees"]. Subject line: reference something specific about their role or company type. Body (150 words max): (1) one sentence on who you are, (2) identify a specific problem they likely have, (3) one sentence on what [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] does about it, (4) one specific result or proof, (5) small ask: [ASK -- e.g., "Is this relevant to your team? Happy to send a sample."]. No pitch deck. No calendar link in the first email.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "our sales enablement platform for mid-market SaaS"
- [TARGET COMPANY TYPE] -- e.g., "B2B SaaS companies with 10-50 sales reps and no dedicated enablement team"
- [ASK] -- e.g., "Is this on your radar? Happy to share what we did for a similar team."

## Prompt 2: Cold Outreach Follow-Up Sequence (EM-17)

**When to use:** After the first cold email gets no response. Most replies come from follow-ups -- this gives you three follow-ups that each add new value instead of "just bumping this up."

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a cold email follow-up specialist. Write a 3-email follow-up sequence following a cold email for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Email 1 (Day 3): add one new piece of value -- a specific insight, stat, or result from a similar company type. Email 2 (Day 7): try a different angle -- address a different pain point than the original email. Email 3 (Day 14): polite final ask -- acknowledge this is the last email, make it easy to reply even with a "not now." Each email: under 100 words.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "our outbound automation platform"
- [NEW VALUE -- Email 1] -- e.g., "a team of 12 SDRs increased their reply rate from 3% to 11% after restructuring their sequences"
- [DIFFERENT PAIN -- Email 2] -- e.g., if original was about reply rates, try ramp time for new reps or pipeline consistency

## Prompt 3: LinkedIn InMail -- Cold Outreach (LI-03)

**When to use:** For LinkedIn Sponsored InMail or direct messages targeting prospects who match your ICP. InMail must feel personal -- mass-blast language kills response rates.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a LinkedIn InMail copywriter. Write a sponsored InMail for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting [JOB TITLE -- e.g., "marketing consultants running their own practice"]. Subject line (60 chars max): make it feel personal and relevant. Body (300 words max): reference something specific about their role, identify the problem [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] solves for people in their position, describe the offer in 2 sentences, and make the ask: [SMALL ASK -- e.g., "Would it be useful? Here's the link"]. No pressure language. Signed from: [SENDER NAME/ROLE].

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "our pipeline management tool for sales teams"
- [JOB TITLE] -- e.g., "VP of Sales at B2B companies with 20-100 employees"
- [SMALL ASK] -- e.g., "Would a 15-minute demo be worth your time? No pressure either way."
- [SENDER NAME/ROLE] -- e.g., "Jake, Account Executive at [Company]"

## Prompt 4: Nurture Email -- Case Study / Mini Story (EM-09)

**When to use:** For mid-funnel leads who've shown interest but haven't booked a demo or committed. Story-based emails build trust faster than feature lists.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a story-driven email writer. Write a nurture email featuring a mini case study for [PRODUCT NAME]. Character: [BUYER TYPE -- e.g., "a freelance marketer managing 4 client accounts"]. Problem they had. What they tried that didn't work. Discovery of [PRODUCT NAME]. One specific result. Lesson for the reader. Under 300 words. Soft CTA at end: invite reader to try [PRODUCT NAME] if they recognize themselves in the story.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "our sales enablement platform"
- [BUYER TYPE] -- e.g., "a VP of Sales at a 40-person SaaS company with reps ramping too slowly"
- [SPECIFIC RESULT] -- e.g., "cut new rep ramp time from 90 days to 45 and hit 120% of quota in Q3"

---

## Prompt 5: Nurture Email -- Final Ask (EM-12)

**When to use:** The last email in a nurture sequence. Be direct about the ask -- by this point, the lead knows who you are. A clear, honest final ask outperforms another value email.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a closing email copywriter. Write the final promotional email in a nurture sequence for [PRODUCT NAME]. This is the last pitch email. Be direct: acknowledge they've received several emails, say you won't keep selling this, and make the final case clearly. Include: what they get, the price, the guarantee, and a direct CTA. Any final urgency: [URGENCY -- e.g., "price increases at end of this week" or "no urgency -- just making the final ask"]. Under 250 words.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "our annual plan for sales teams"
- [URGENCY] -- e.g., "pilot pricing ends Friday -- after that, standard enterprise rates apply"

## Prompt 6: VSL (Video Sales Letter) -- Full Script (VS-04)

**When to use:** For a video sales letter on a landing page or in a sales funnel. VSLs convert prospects who prefer watching over reading -- especially in B2B where decision-makers skim pages but watch videos.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a VSL scriptwriter. Write a 7-minute VSL script for [PRODUCT NAME] at [PRICE]. Structure: Hook/Problem (0-1 min), Agitation (1-2:30 min), Solution intro (2:30-3:30 min), Product demo/walkthrough (3:30-5 min), Social proof (5-5:45 min), Offer + guarantee (5:45-6:30 min), CTA (6:30-7 min). ~1,050 spoken words. Include [SLIDE NOTES] for any supporting visuals. Conversational spoken-word style -- not read-out loud marketing copy.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "SalesOS -- the pipeline management platform for scaling teams"
- [PRICE] -- e.g., "$299/seat/month" or "custom pricing based on team size"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] -- e.g., "teams averaging 34% more closed deals within 60 days"

## Prompt 7: Objection Handler -- Inline Copy (LP-19)

**When to use:** For sales pages, pitch decks, or one-pagers where you need to handle silent objections right next to the conversion point. These are micro-copy pieces placed near pricing, CTAs, and testimonials.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as an inline objection handler copywriter. Write 5 micro-copy objection handlers for [PRODUCT NAME]'s sales page. Each: 1-2 sentences, placed next to a specific page element. (1) Under the price: address "is it worth it?" (2) Under the CTA button: address "is this actually for me?" (3) Near the testimonials: address "are these real results?" (4) Near the guarantee: address "what does risk-free actually mean?" (5) In the FAQ: address "I've bought things like this before and didn't use them."

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., your sales tool, platform, or service offering
- Customize each micro-copy answer to your actual product terms and customer experience

## Prompt 8: Sales Page -- Long-Form Structure (LP-49)

**When to use:** When building a full sales page for a product, service, or SaaS offering. This gives you the complete architectural outline with the psychological purpose of each section.

Include every section in order with: section name, psychological purpose (what it does for the reader), copy type needed, and word count target. Sections to include: above-fold, problem, solution, product details, social proof, FAQ, guarantee, pricing, closing CTA. Total page: 1,000-1,500 words. Include optional and required sections.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a conversion copywriter. Write an AIDA-framework Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. The attention hook must address [ATTENTION HOOK -- e.g., a surprising statistic or bold claim]. Interest section: explain what [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] does in one sentence. Desire section: list 3 specific benefits using "you" language. Action: one clear CTA sentence with urgency.

## Prompt 10: Facebook Ad -- Retargeting (FB-04)

**When to use:** For retargeting people who visited your sales page or demo page but didn't convert. This audience is warm -- they just need one objection handled or one reason to come back.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a retargeting ad specialist. Write a Facebook retargeting ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting people who visited [LANDING PAGE URL/DESCRIPTION -- e.g., "the sales page for my AI prompt pack"] but didn't purchase. Acknowledge that they've seen the product without being creepy. Address the most likely objection: [TOP OBJECTION -- e.g., "not sure if it's worth $47"]. Offer a compelling reason to return now: [INCENTIVE -- e.g., "limited-time bonus: free email swipe file added to the bundle"]. Primary text under 100 words. Include headline and description.

## Prompt 11: "Who Is This For" Section (LP-20)

**When to use:** For sales pages and one-pagers where you need to qualify the buyer. This section makes the right prospects feel seen and filters out bad-fit leads before they waste your team's time.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a targeting section copywriter. Write a "who is this for" section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s landing page. Format: two subsections. "This is for you if:" -- 5 specific "you" statements identifying the ideal buyer. "This is NOT for you if:" -- 3 honest statements about who shouldn't buy. Each statement: under 20 words. Honest over optimistic -- wrong buyers cause chargebacks and bad reviews.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., your sales tool or service
- [FOR YOU IF] -- e.g., "You have 5+ reps and your pipeline data lives in spreadsheets"
- [NOT FOR YOU IF] -- e.g., "You're a solo founder doing all sales yourself (we're built for teams)"
