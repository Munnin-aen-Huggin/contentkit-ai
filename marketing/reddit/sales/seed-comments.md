## Comment 1

**Thread title:** "Cold email is dead. Change my mind."

**Comment:**

Cold email isn't dead -- bad cold email is dead. The problem is that 95% of cold emails follow the same structure: "Hi [First Name], I noticed your company does [thing]. We help companies like yours [vague benefit]. Want to hop on a 15-minute call?"

That template is dead. But cold email as a channel still works if you fix the three things that kill reply rates:

First, the subject line. Stop using "Quick question" or anything that sounds like a template. Reference something specific about their company, their role, or their industry. Make it feel like it was written for one person.

Second, the opening line. Never open with who you are. Open with their problem. "You have 15 reps and no enablement team -- which means your best reps are ramping new hires instead of closing deals." That earns the next sentence.

Third, the ask. A calendar link in the first email is the equivalent of proposing on a first date. Ask something small: "Is this even on your radar?" or "Worth a look?" Small asks get replies. Big asks get archived.

I've seen teams go from 2% to 9% reply rates just by restructuring their emails around these three changes. The channel works. The execution is what's broken for most teams.

**Thread title:** "How do you write follow-up emails that don't sound desperate?"

**Comment:**

The desperation comes from repetition. If every follow-up is a variation of "Did you see my last email?" -- it sounds desperate because it is. You're not offering anything new. You're just asking again.

The fix is simple: every follow-up must add something the previous email didn't have. A new insight, a different pain point, a relevant stat, a case study. If you can't think of something new to add, you don't have a follow-up problem -- you have a value problem.

My framework for a 3-touch follow-up sequence: Email 2 (Day 3) adds a specific data point or result from a company similar to theirs. Email 3 (Day 7) addresses a completely different pain point than the original email. Email 4 (Day 14) acknowledges this is the last email and makes the reply bar as low as possible -- "even a 'not now' is helpful."

The tone shift matters too. Your first email should be confident and direct. Your last email should be genuinely respectful of their time. The progression from "here's why this matters" to "totally understand if the timing is off" reads as professional, not pushy.

One more thing: never use "Just bumping this to the top of your inbox." It's the cold email equivalent of "per my last email." It signals you have nothing new to say.

## Comment 3

**Thread title:** "What's your process for handling objections on discovery calls?"

**Comment:**

The biggest shift I made with objection handling was realizing that most objections aren't objections -- they're requests for more information disguised as pushback. "It's too expensive" usually means "I don't understand the value yet." "We're not ready" usually means "I can't justify this to my boss."

So instead of overcoming objections, I started diagnosing them. When someone says "the price is too high," I don't counter with ROI numbers immediately. I ask: "Too high compared to what?" That question reveals whether they're comparing you to a competitor, to doing nothing, or to an internal budget constraint. Each requires a completely different response.

Three things that consistently work:

Acknowledge first. "That's a fair concern" or "I hear that a lot" -- then pause. Let them elaborate. Half the time they'll talk themselves into the answer.

Isolate the objection. "If the pricing worked for you, is this something you'd move forward on?" This tells you whether price is the real issue or just the easiest one to raise.

Use their words, not yours. If they said "we need to move fast," bring that language back when addressing the objection: "You mentioned speed is critical -- here's how we get you live in two weeks instead of two months."

The reps who handle objections best aren't the smoothest talkers. They're the best listeners.
