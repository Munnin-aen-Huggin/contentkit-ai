## Comment 1

**Thread title:** "How do you handle scope creep without losing the client?"

**Comment:**

The biggest shift I made was moving from hourly billing to project-based pricing with a clearly defined scope document. Not a contract addendum -- an actual one-page scope doc that lists exactly what's included, how many revisions, and what counts as "out of scope."

When a client asks for something extra, I don't say no. I say: "Absolutely, I can do that. Here's what that adds to the project." Then I send a quick one-line change order with the additional cost. Most of the time, they either say yes (and you get paid fairly) or they realize it wasn't that important.

The key is framing it as professionalism, not pushback. Clients respect freelancers who have a process. The ones who don't respect it are clients you don't want anyway. I lost maybe two clients early on by holding this boundary, but the ones who stayed became my best long-term accounts because they saw me as a professional, not a vending machine.

Start with the scope doc on your next project and see how it changes the dynamic.

**Thread title:** "Struggling to find clients beyond Upwork -- where else should I look?"

**Comment:**

Upwork is fine for getting started, but the real leverage is in channels where you're not competing with 200 other proposals. Three things that consistently work:

First, LinkedIn content. Not cold DMs -- actual posts where you share what you know. Even once a week. It positions you as someone who understands the work, and inbound leads from LinkedIn close at a much higher rate than marketplace bids.

Second, niche communities. If you're a copywriter for SaaS companies, go where SaaS founders hang out -- specific Slack groups, subreddits, indie hacker forums. Answer questions genuinely. People notice.

Third, past clients. Most freelancers never ask for referrals. A simple email 2-3 weeks after project delivery -- "Know anyone who might need similar work?" -- has generated more business for me than any platform.

The pattern is the same: be visible where your ideal clients already are, and lead with value instead of a pitch. It takes longer to build than a marketplace profile, but the quality of work and rates are in a different league.

**Thread title:** "How do you write proposals that actually win projects?"

**Comment:**

I used to spend 2-3 hours per proposal and close maybe 10-15% of them. Now I spend 30-45 minutes and close around 50%. The difference wasn't writing more -- it was restructuring what I wrote.

The structure that works: start with their problem (not your credentials), show you understand their specific situation, outline the approach in 3-4 clear steps, include one specific result from similar past work, and make the pricing section dead simple -- no line items, just the outcome they're buying and the investment.

Two things most freelancers get wrong: they lead with "About Me" (the client doesn't care yet), and they present 3 pricing tiers when the client just wants to know what the right option costs. One price, one scope, one clear next step.

Also -- and this sounds counterintuitive -- shorter proposals win more often. A one-page proposal that nails their problem beats a five-page document that covers everything. Decision fatigue kills deals. Make it easy to say yes.
