**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for freelancers who spend too much time writing client deliverables

**Body:**

I've been freelancing for a while now, and one thing that always ate into my margins was the sheer volume of writing that goes into client work -- proposals, emails, social media captions, ad copy, landing pages, blog outlines. The actual strategy and creative direction is the valuable part, but the first-draft production was taking up half my week.

About six months ago I started building a library of structured AI prompts for every type of deliverable I was producing. Not generic "write me a blog post" prompts -- prompts with specific frameworks, roles, word counts, and variables you fill in per client. The difference in output quality was night and day compared to what most people get from ChatGPT.

I pulled 15 of the most useful ones into a free guide specifically for freelancers doing client work. Here's what's inside:

- **Cold outreach + follow-up sequences** -- for landing new clients or writing outreach for clients
- **LinkedIn content** -- thought leadership and tactical posts that build your credibility
- **Landing page copy** -- above-the-fold sections, feature-to-benefit bullets, FAQ sections
- **Brand strategy** -- positioning statements and ICPs to anchor all your client work
- **Ad copy** -- Facebook ads (AIDA + benefit-driven), Google responsive search ad headlines
- **SEO** -- blog post outlines with keyword targeting and heading hierarchy
- **Video scripts** -- YouTube tutorial scripts for client content production
- **Social media** -- Instagram captions that actually drive engagement

Each prompt is copy-paste ready with customizable variables. I use these daily across multiple client accounts and they've probably saved me 10-12 hours a week on first drafts alone.

No email gate, no signup. Just the prompts.

If you try any of them, I'd genuinely like to hear which ones you found most useful. Happy to answer questions about how I use them in my workflow.
