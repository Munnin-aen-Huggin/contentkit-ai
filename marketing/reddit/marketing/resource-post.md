**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for marketing teams who waste hours writing copy from scratch

---

**Body:**

I spent the last few months building a library of AI marketing prompts -- structured prompts you paste into ChatGPT or Claude that produce actual usable output instead of generic fluff.

The difference between a good AI prompt and a bad one is the same difference between a good creative brief and a vague one. Most people type "write me a Facebook ad" and get something they would never run. But when you give AI a specific copywriting framework (like AIDA or PAS), a defined role, and clear variables about your product and audience, the output goes from unusable to "I can run this after one edit."

I pulled 15 of these prompts into a free Google Doc for marketing teams. It covers:

- **Ads** -- AIDA-framework Facebook ads, before/after transformation ads, Google search ad descriptions
- **Email** -- welcome sequences, flash sale emails
- **Social** -- LinkedIn thought leadership posts, Twitter/X educational threads
- **Landing pages** -- benefit bullets, pricing section copy, closing CTAs
- **SEO** -- keyword-targeted blog outlines, pillar content structure plans
- **Brand strategy** -- messaging hierarchy, messaging pillars
- **Product launch** -- multi-platform launch day posts
- **Video** -- YouTube hook scripts in 5 variants

Each prompt includes the context for when to use it, the full prompt text you copy-paste, and the variables you swap in for your business.

Here is the doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_MARKETING]

No email gate, no signup, no pitch. Just the prompts.

I built these because I was tired of seeing the same advice -- "just use AI for your marketing" -- without anyone showing the actual prompts that make it work. These are the ones I use daily.

If you grab it, I would genuinely appreciate feedback on which prompts work best and which categories you would want more of. Happy to answer questions in the comments.
