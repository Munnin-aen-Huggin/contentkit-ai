## r/sales

### Day 1 -- Seed Comment #1
**Find a post about:** "Cold email is dead. Change my mind." (or any thread debating whether cold email still works)

**Comment to post:**

Cold email isn't dead -- bad cold email is dead. The problem is that 95% of cold emails follow the same structure: "Hi [First Name], I noticed your company does [thing]. We help companies like yours [vague benefit]. Want to hop on a 15-minute call?"

That template is dead. But cold email as a channel still works if you fix the three things that kill reply rates:

First, the subject line. Stop using "Quick question" or anything that sounds like a template. Reference something specific about their company, their role, or their industry. Make it feel like it was written for one person.

Second, the opening line. Never open with who you are. Open with their problem. "You have 15 reps and no enablement team -- which means your best reps are ramping new hires instead of closing deals." That earns the next sentence.

Third, the ask. A calendar link in the first email is the equivalent of proposing on a first date. Ask something small: "Is this even on your radar?" or "Worth a look?" Small asks get replies. Big asks get archived.

I've seen teams go from 2% to 9% reply rates just by restructuring their emails around these three changes. The channel works. The execution is what's broken for most teams.

### Day 3 -- Seed Comment #2
**Find a post about:** "How do you write follow-up emails that don't sound desperate?" (or any thread about follow-up cadence or sequence writing)

**Comment to post:**

The desperation comes from repetition. If every follow-up is a variation of "Did you see my last email?" -- it sounds desperate because it is. You're not offering anything new. You're just asking again.

The fix is simple: every follow-up must add something the previous email didn't have. A new insight, a different pain point, a relevant stat, a case study. If you can't think of something new to add, you don't have a follow-up problem -- you have a value problem.

My framework for a 3-touch follow-up sequence: Email 2 (Day 3) adds a specific data point or result from a company similar to theirs. Email 3 (Day 7) addresses a completely different pain point than the original email. Email 4 (Day 14) acknowledges this is the last email and makes the reply bar as low as possible -- "even a 'not now' is helpful."

The tone shift matters too. Your first email should be confident and direct. Your last email should be genuinely respectful of their time. The progression from "here's why this matters" to "totally understand if the timing is off" reads as professional, not pushy.

One more thing: never use "Just bumping this to the top of your inbox." It's the cold email equivalent of "per my last email." It signals you have nothing new to say.

### Day 5 -- Seed Comment #3
**Find a post about:** "What's your process for handling objections on discovery calls?" (or any thread about objection handling, discovery call tactics, or overcoming pushback)

**Comment to post:**

The biggest shift I made with objection handling was realizing that most objections aren't objections -- they're requests for more information disguised as pushback. "It's too expensive" usually means "I don't understand the value yet." "We're not ready" usually means "I can't justify this to my boss."

So instead of overcoming objections, I started diagnosing them. When someone says "the price is too high," I don't counter with ROI numbers immediately. I ask: "Too high compared to what?" That question reveals whether they're comparing you to a competitor, to doing nothing, or to an internal budget constraint. Each requires a completely different response.

Three things that consistently work:

Acknowledge first. "That's a fair concern" or "I hear that a lot" -- then pause. Let them elaborate. Half the time they'll talk themselves into the answer.

Isolate the objection. "If the pricing worked for you, is this something you'd move forward on?" This tells you whether price is the real issue or just the easiest one to raise.

Use their words, not yours. If they said "we need to move fast," bring that language back when addressing the objection: "You mentioned speed is critical -- here's how we get you live in two weeks instead of two months."

The reps who handle objections best aren't the smoothest talkers. They're the best listeners.

### Day 8 -- Resource Post
**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for sales teams who waste hours writing cold emails and follow-ups from scratch

**Body:**

I've been building AI-powered marketing and sales tools for a while, and one thing I kept hearing from sales teams was the same complaint: they spend a massive chunk of their week writing -- cold emails, follow-ups, LinkedIn messages, internal pitch decks, sales page copy -- and most of it gets written from scratch every time, even when the structure should be repeatable.

The problem isn't that reps can't write. It's that writing good sales copy from a blank page is a different skill than selling, and most reps don't have a system for it. So they default to the same templates everyone else uses, and their reply rates reflect it.

I put together a free guide with 12 structured AI prompts built specifically for sales professionals. These aren't "write me a cold email" prompts -- each one has a tested framework, specific structure, word count targets, and variables you customize for your product, prospect, and market.

Here's what's inside:

- **Cold outreach** -- B2B prospecting emails that lead with the prospect's problem, not your pitch
- **Follow-up sequences** -- 3-email sequences where every follow-up adds new value
- **LinkedIn InMail** -- cold outreach that reads like a personal message, not a sales blast
- **Nurture emails** -- story-based case study emails and direct final-ask closers
- **Video sales letters** -- 7-minute VSL scripts with full structure and slide notes
- **Sales page architecture** -- complete long-form sales page outlines with psychological section mapping
- **Objection handling copy** -- inline micro-copy for sales pages and pitch decks
- **Retargeting ads** -- Facebook ad copy for warm leads who visited but didn't convert
- **Targeting sections** -- "who is this for / not for" copy that qualifies buyers before the call
- **Re-engagement emails** -- for leads who went cold without a response

Every prompt works with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Copy, paste, fill in the variables, and get usable copy in minutes.

Here's the Google Doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_SALES]

No email required. No signup. Just the prompts.

If you try any of them on your outbound, I'd genuinely like to hear what reply rates you see. Happy to answer questions about how to customize them for specific verticals.

## r/realtors

### Day 1 -- Seed Comment #1
**Find a post about:** "How are you guys generating leads that aren't from Zillow or Realtor.com?" (or any thread about lead generation beyond paid portals)

**Comment to post:**

The best lead source I've found outside the portals is hyper-local content marketing. Not generic "5 tips for home buyers" blog posts -- actual neighborhood-specific content that ranks on Google when someone searches "best neighborhoods in [your city] for families" or "moving to [your area] guide."

I write one long-form blog post per month targeting a specific local keyword. Each post covers a single neighborhood or topic in real depth -- school ratings, price ranges, walkability, the stuff people actually want to know before they relocate. Over time, these posts compound. I'm getting 15-20 organic leads per month from posts I wrote over a year ago.

The key is specificity. "Real estate in Austin" is too broad. "Best neighborhoods in South Austin for young families under $500K" is a post that matches exactly what someone types into Google. Those leads are high intent because they're already researching your market. They just need an agent who clearly knows the area.

It takes 3-6 months to build momentum, but the leads are free and they already trust you because you taught them something useful.

### Day 3 -- Seed Comment #2
**Find a post about:** "What do you put in your listing descriptions that actually makes a difference?" (or any thread about MLS descriptions, listing copy, or property marketing)

**Comment to post:**

The biggest mistake I see in listing descriptions is leading with specs. "Beautiful 4-bedroom, 3-bath home with open floor plan" describes 80% of listings on the market. It's invisible.

What works is leading with the lifestyle outcome, not the feature list. Instead of "renovated kitchen with quartz countertops," try "the kitchen where Saturday morning pancakes actually happen -- 12-foot island, quartz tops, and a window that looks out over the backyard."

I structure mine in three parts: open with the emotional hook (what it feels like to live there), then the key differentiators (what makes this house different from the 15 others in the same price range), and close with the practical details (beds, baths, sqft, lot size, school district).

The emotional hook is what makes someone click "Schedule Tour" instead of scrolling to the next listing. Specs confirm the decision. They don't make it. Spend 80% of your writing effort on the first two sentences and you'll see a measurable difference in showing requests.

### Day 5 -- Seed Comment #3
**Find a post about:** "Follow-up emails -- how often is too often after a showing?" (or any thread about follow-up cadence, nurturing leads, or staying in touch with buyers)

**Comment to post:**

The frequency matters less than the content. If every follow-up email is "Just checking in! Still interested?" -- once is too often. If every email adds something new and useful, you can follow up weekly without being annoying.

My sequence after a showing: Day 1 -- a brief personal note referencing something specific they said about the property (not a form email). Day 3 -- send them a comparable that just hit the market or a price change on something similar, with one sentence of context. Day 7 -- share a neighborhood insight: a new restaurant opening nearby, school ratings, commute data. Day 14 -- honest check-in acknowledging the timeline.

Each email gives them a reason to open it beyond "this agent wants my commission." The agents who struggle with follow-up are usually sending the same "touching base" email on repeat. Leads go cold because there's nothing new to engage with.

One more thing: never follow up with "Are you still looking?" Ask a specific question instead, like "Did you end up visiting that open house on Elm Street?" Specific questions get specific answers. Generic questions get ignored.

### Day 8 -- Resource Post
**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for agents who know they need better marketing but don't have a marketing team

**Body:**

I've been working on AI-powered marketing systems for a while, and I kept running into the same pattern with real estate agents: you know you need better listing descriptions, follow-up emails, social media content, and local SEO -- but you don't have 10 hours a week to produce it, and hiring a marketing person at $3-5K/month doesn't make sense for most solo agents or small teams.

So I put together a free guide with 12 structured AI prompts built specifically for real estate marketing. These aren't generic "write me a listing description" prompts -- each one has a specific framework, word count targets, and variables you fill in for your market and listings.

Here's what's covered:

- **Listing descriptions** that lead with lifestyle, not just specs
- **Follow-up emails** -- story-based nurture emails that give leads a reason to reply, plus a referral request template for past clients
- **Social media content** -- Instagram captions and Facebook community posts designed for local engagement
- **Local SEO** -- location-targeted page descriptions and business listing copy for Google Business, Yelp, and directories
- **Google Ads** -- keyword-matched ad copy variants for your market
- **LinkedIn content** -- trend commentary posts that attract referral partners and relocation clients
- **Video scripts** -- property tour scripts with a result-first structure
- **Email newsletters** -- a weekly template that keeps your sphere of influence engaged
- **Blog content** -- SEO listicle outlines for "best neighborhoods" type posts that drive organic leads

Every prompt is copy-paste ready. I use these in my own work and they've dramatically cut the time it takes to produce professional marketing content.

Here's the Google Doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_REALTORS]

No email required, no signup wall. Just the prompts.

Would love to hear which ones resonate with your business. Happy to answer any questions about how to customize them for your specific market.

## r/accounting

### Day 1 -- Seed Comment #1
**Find a post about:** "How do you get new clients beyond word of mouth? Our firm's growth has plateaued." (or any thread about firm growth, client acquisition, or marketing for accountants)

**Comment to post:**

Word of mouth is great until it isn't -- you can't control the volume or timing. The firms I've seen break through the plateau all added one specific thing: content that ranks on Google for the searches their ideal clients are already making.

Think about it -- when a business owner searches "do I need a CPA for my LLC" or "small business tax deductions I'm missing," that's a person with a problem actively looking for someone who knows the answer. If your firm's blog post is the one they find, you're already positioned as the expert before they ever call.

You don't need to publish weekly. One well-researched, keyword-targeted blog post per month -- focused on a specific question your ideal client would search -- compounds over time. After 12 months, you've got 12 pages ranking and driving leads while you sleep.

Pair that with a Google Business Profile that's fully optimized with real photos, consistent NAP info, and regular review responses, and you've got a lead engine that doesn't depend on someone happening to mention your name at a dinner party. The firms growing fastest right now are treating their website like a second office, not a brochure.

### Day 3 -- Seed Comment #2
**Find a post about:** "Tax season is coming -- how do you handle the communication overload with clients?" (or any thread about client management during busy season, inbox overload, or tax season workflow)

**Comment to post:**

The communication bottleneck during tax season usually isn't volume -- it's repetition. You're answering the same 15 questions hundreds of times. The fix that saved my sanity was creating a structured onboarding sequence that answers questions before clients ask them.

I set up a simple email sequence that goes out automatically when a client starts their engagement: email 1 is the document checklist with exact file names and formats, email 2 (3 days later) covers the 5 most common questions with clear answers, email 3 (day 7) is a status update template.

The result: client emails dropped by roughly 40% during filing season because people had the information before they needed to ask. The clients who did email had specific, answerable questions instead of "where are we at?"

The other thing that helped: setting clear response time expectations upfront. "We respond to all emails within one business day during filing season" eliminates the anxiety that drives people to follow up three times. Most client frustration isn't about speed -- it's about uncertainty. Remove the uncertainty and the inbox calms down significantly.

### Day 5 -- Seed Comment #3
**Find a post about:** "Should accounting firms be on LinkedIn? Feels like it's mostly recruiters and motivational posts." (or any thread about social media marketing for accountants, LinkedIn strategy, or firm visibility)

**Comment to post:**

LinkedIn is probably the single best marketing channel for accounting firms, specifically because most firms ignore it. The bar is low and the audience is exactly right -- business owners, CFOs, attorneys, and financial advisors are all there.

The key is not posting generic firm updates like "Congratulations to our team on another great tax season." Nobody engages with that. What works is sharing specific, useful insights that your audience can apply. A post like "One tax planning move that saves most restaurant owners $5-10K -- and why October is the deadline to do it" will outperform any firm announcement.

Three posts per month is enough. One educational tip (a specific, actionable insight), one trend commentary (your take on a regulatory change or industry development), and one client success story (anonymized, focused on the outcome and what made it possible). That cadence builds authority without feeling like a full-time content job.

The attorneys and financial advisors in your network notice this content too. I've gotten more referral partnerships from LinkedIn posts than from any networking event. You're demonstrating expertise publicly, which makes it easy for them to refer clients your way with confidence.

### Day 8 -- Resource Post
**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for accounting firms who want more clients but don't have a marketing budget

**Body:**

I've spent a lot of time working on AI-powered marketing tools, and one group that consistently gets overlooked is accounting firms. You're excellent at the work, but most firms rely almost entirely on referrals for growth -- and when referrals slow down, there's no system to replace them.

The problem usually isn't that firms don't want to do marketing. It's that nobody in the firm has time to write blog posts, optimize Google listings, run ads, and maintain a LinkedIn presence on top of actual client work. And hiring a marketing agency at $3-5K/month feels hard to justify when you're not sure what the ROI looks like.

So I put together a free guide with 10 structured AI prompts built for accounting firm marketing. These aren't generic prompts -- each one is designed for a specific marketing task with frameworks, word counts, and variables you customize for your firm and market.

Here's what's inside:

- **Local SEO** -- location-targeted website copy and Google Business Profile descriptions that rank for "[service] in [city]" searches
- **Blog content** -- SEO outlines and listicle templates for tax season topics, deduction guides, and business formation content
- **Email newsletters** -- a weekly tip format that keeps clients and prospects engaged year-round
- **LinkedIn authority posts** -- thought leadership and trend commentary templates that attract referral partners and business owner clients
- **Google Ads** -- responsive search ad headlines and keyword-matched ad copy for your service areas
- **Referral emails** -- a natural, non-awkward template for asking satisfied clients to refer
- **Business listings** -- consistent citation copy for Google, Yelp, and professional directories

Each prompt works with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Copy, paste, fill in the variables for your firm, and get professional marketing copy in minutes.

Here's the Google Doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_ACCOUNTING]

No email gate, no signup. If any of these are useful for your firm, I'd genuinely like to hear about it. Happy to answer questions.

## r/copywriting

### Day 1 -- Seed Comment #1
**Find a post about:** "How do you use AI without it making all your copy sound the same?" (or any thread about AI tools for copywriting, ChatGPT copy quality, or maintaining voice with AI)

**Comment to post:**

The reason most AI copy sounds identical is because most people give it identical prompts. "Write me a sales email" gives you the same output as everyone else who typed "write me a sales email." The AI is not the bottleneck -- your brief is.

Two things fix this immediately. First, give the AI a specific copywriting framework. Do not say "write an ad." Say "write an ad using PAS structure -- open with a specific pain my audience recognizes, spend two sentences amplifying the cost of that pain, then position my product as the solution." When the AI has structural constraints, the output sounds like intentional copywriting, not filler.

Second, feed it your voice. Paste in two or three paragraphs of your existing copy and tell it to match that tone. Say "match the rhythm and vocabulary of this sample -- short sentences, no corporate language, contractions allowed." The AI adapts surprisingly well when you give it something real to anchor to.

AI copy still needs editing. But the difference between a 20-minute edit on a structured first draft and a 3-hour blank-page writing session is the difference between billing more and burning out.

### Day 3 -- Seed Comment #2
**Find a post about:** "What's the best framework for writing landing pages? I keep getting stuck on structure." (or any thread about landing page copy, sales page structure, or conversion page layout)

**Comment to post:**

The framework depends on traffic temperature, but here is the one that works for most direct-response landing pages.

Above the fold: outcome-focused headline (under 10 words), subheadline that clarifies who it is for and how it works, three proof signals (buyer count, star rating, guarantee), and a CTA. This section has one job -- earn the scroll.

Problem section: five to seven pain point bullets that make the reader feel understood. Each bullet should describe a specific situation, not a vague frustration. "Spending Sunday nights rewriting the same email for the third time" beats "struggling with email marketing."

Solution section: what changes when they use your product. Three outcome bullets in "now you can" format. Then a brief description of what is literally inside the product.

Social proof section: do not just say "testimonials." Frame them with a header that references a specific result or customer count.

FAQ section: write eight questions, each one addressing a real objection -- pricing, fit, guarantee, comparison to free alternatives, time investment, and who this is not for.

Closing CTA: brief. Headline, one-sentence offer recap, benefit statement, guarantee, button.

The key is that every section has one psychological job. Problem creates identification. Solution creates desire. Proof creates trust. CTA creates action. If a section is not doing its job, cut it.

### Day 5 -- Seed Comment #3
**Find a post about:** "How do you write a VSL script? I've never done video copy before." (or any thread about video sales letters, VSL structure, or video copy)

**Comment to post:**

A VSL (Video Sales Letter) follows the same structure as a long-form sales page, but written for the ear instead of the eye. The biggest mistake copywriters make with their first VSL is writing it like a blog post that someone reads out loud. It should sound like someone talking to a friend at a coffee shop about a problem they solved.

The standard structure for a 7-minute VSL is: Hook (0-1 minute) -- one specific problem statement that makes the viewer lean in. Agitation (1-2.5 minutes) -- three pain scenarios that make the problem feel urgent and personal. Solution intro (2.5-3.5 minutes) -- introduce the product and the mechanism. Demo or walkthrough (3.5-5 minutes) -- show what is inside, step by step. Social proof (5-5.45 minutes) -- buyer results. Offer and guarantee (5.45-6.5 minutes). CTA (6.5-7 minutes).

Write it at about 150 words per minute of spoken word. Use short sentences. Read it out loud as you write -- if you stumble on a sentence, rewrite it. The conversational tone is what separates a VSL that converts from a VSL that sounds like a corporate training video.

### Day 8 -- Resource Post
**Title:** I made a free prompt sheet for copywriters who use AI to speed up first drafts

**Body:**

I am a copywriter. I use AI every day. Not to replace the craft -- to skip the blank page and get to the editing phase faster.

The problem with most AI prompts is they produce generic output because they lack the structure that makes good copy work. When you tell ChatGPT "write me a Facebook ad," you get something that sounds like it was written by a committee. But when you give it a specific framework -- AIDA, PAS, before/after, story-format -- and define the role, audience, and variables, the output jumps to a quality level where editing is actually productive instead of a rewrite.

I compiled 10 of these prompts into a free Google Doc, focused specifically on the frameworks copywriters use daily:

- **Ad frameworks** -- AIDA-structure Facebook ads, before/after transformation ads, story-format narrative ads
- **Long-form sales copy** -- VSL script structure (full 7-minute outline), problem section agitation, intro story lead, closing CTA sections
- **Sales page architecture** -- complete VSL outline with timestamps and section purposes
- **Strategic deliverables** -- messaging hierarchy frameworks that make you look like a strategist, not just a writer
- **Emails** -- flash sale copy with countdown structure

Each prompt includes context for when to use it, the full prompt you copy-paste, and variables you customize per client.

Here is the doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_COPYWRITING]

No email gate. No funnel. Just the prompts.

I built these because the conversation around "AI vs. copywriters" misses the point entirely. The copywriters who are winning right now are the ones who use AI for the 80% that is structural -- first drafts, variant generation, framework application -- and spend their time on the 20% that is actually craft: voice, strategy, and the edits that turn good copy into great copy.

These prompts handle the structural 80%. You bring the other 20%.

Curious which frameworks you use most in your workflow -- happy to discuss in comments.
