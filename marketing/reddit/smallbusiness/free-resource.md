## Prompt 1: Facebook Lead Gen Ad -- Free Resource Offer

**When to use:** To drive email list signups via Facebook Lead Gen forms. The offer must be clear and specific -- vague "free guides" don't convert. This prompt builds copy around a specific lead magnet.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a lead generation copywriter. Write a Facebook Lead Gen ad offering [LEAD MAGNET NAME -- e.g., "a free PDF: 5 AI Prompts That Replace a $5K Copywriter"]. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Headline must communicate the specific value of the lead magnet in under 40 characters. Primary text (under 125 words): open with the core promise, state who it's for, list 3 specific things they'll get or learn, end with a low-friction CTA ("Grab it free" or "Download now"). Do not use "newsletter" or "subscribe" language.

**Variables to customize:**
- [LEAD MAGNET NAME] -- e.g., "Free checklist: 10 things to do before your first Facebook ad"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] -- e.g., "local business owners spending money on ads for the first time"
- [3 SPECIFIC OUTCOMES] -- e.g., "set your daily budget / pick the right objective / write your first ad"

## Prompt 2: Facebook Page Post -- Community Engagement

**When to use:** For organic Facebook Page posts designed to generate comments and engagement. Facebook's algorithm deprioritizes promotional posts -- engagement-first content builds the page reach needed for ads to perform.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a Facebook community post writer. Write an organic Facebook post for [BRAND PAGE NAME] that drives comments on [TOPIC -- e.g., "how your audience uses AI for their marketing"]. Format: share a relatable observation or question, give your own take in 2-3 sentences, end with a specific, easy-to-answer question. Under 150 words. Do not include links -- Facebook suppresses posts with outbound links.

**Variables to customize:**
- [BRAND PAGE NAME] -- e.g., "Main Street Bakery" or "Smith Plumbing"
- [TOPIC] -- a topic where your customers have opinions
- [QUESTION] -- make it specific enough to answer in 1-3 sentences

## Prompt 3: Instagram Caption -- Product Feature (Single Image)

**When to use:** For a single-image product post on Instagram. The caption must work without the visual -- assume the image shows the product, so the caption sells the benefit and context.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as an Instagram product copywriter. Write a single-image Instagram product caption for [PRODUCT NAME]. Structure: (1) open with a benefit statement, not the product name, (2) 2-3 sentences expanding on who it's for and what they get, (3) social proof line (one number or quote), (4) CTA with link-in-bio instruction. Under 125 words. Use line breaks for readability. Include 5 relevant hashtags at the end.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "Handmade Soy Candles" or "Landscaping Services"
- [BENEFIT] -- e.g., "Your living room smells like a spa for under $25"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] -- e.g., "500+ sold this year" or "4.9 stars on Google"
