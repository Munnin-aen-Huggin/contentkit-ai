## Comment 1

**Hypothetical thread title:** "I'm spending $500/month on Facebook ads and getting nothing. Should I just stop?"

**Comment:**

Before you stop, diagnose the problem. $500/month is enough to get results if it is targeted correctly, but most small business owners make the same three mistakes.

First, check your audience. If you are running interest-based targeting to cold audiences, you are paying Facebook to guess who your customers are. Instead, upload your customer email list (even if it is just 100 people) and create a lookalike audience. Facebook will find people who resemble your actual buyers.

Second, look at your ad copy. If your ad describes what your product does instead of what problem it solves, people will scroll past. Lead with the pain point. "Tired of waiting 3 weeks for a plumber?" works better than "We offer residential plumbing services."

Third, check your landing page. If your ad sends people to your homepage instead of a page specifically about the thing the ad promised, your conversion rate will be near zero. The ad and the landing page need to tell the same story.

Try fixing these three things before turning off the budget entirely. $500 is workable -- the targeting and messaging just need to match.

## Comment 2

**Hypothetical thread title:** "How do other small business owners handle marketing with zero budget?"

**Comment:**

The honest answer is that you trade time for money. But the key is choosing the right time investments, because most free marketing activities have terrible returns.

Here is what actually works at zero budget. First, get your Google Business Profile completely filled out -- photos, services, hours, and a description with your location and service type. This is free and it is how most local customers find you. Ask your top five customers for a Google review this week. Five genuine reviews with responses from you will outperform months of social media posting.

Second, pick one social platform where your customers actually spend time. Not all of them -- one. Post three times a week with content that helps your audience, not content that promotes your business. If you are a landscaper, post seasonal lawn care tips. If you are an accountant, post tax deadline reminders. Helpful content builds trust before someone ever needs to hire you.

Third, start an email list even if it is just a spreadsheet. Every customer and lead goes on it. A monthly email to 50 real contacts will outperform 1,000 Instagram followers who will never buy.

## Comment 3

**Hypothetical thread title:** "Is it worth paying for a website or can I just use social media?"

**Comment:**

You need a website, and it does not need to cost more than $200 to start. Here is why social media alone is a risk.

You do not own your social media audience. If Facebook changes its algorithm tomorrow (and it will), your organic reach drops to near zero overnight. This has happened multiple times. Businesses that built entirely on Facebook Pages in 2015 lost almost all their organic reach by 2018.

A website gives you three things social media cannot. First, you own the SEO traffic. When someone Googles "plumber near me" or "best cupcakes in [your city]," your website can show up. Your Instagram page cannot. Second, you control the experience. Your website has one job -- getting the visitor to call you, book online, or buy. Social media has a thousand distractions competing for attention. Third, you own the email list. A simple lead capture form on your website builds an asset that no platform change can take away from you.

Start with a one-page site: what you do, who you serve, proof it works (reviews), and how to contact you. You can build this on Carrd for $19 per year or on Squarespace for $16 per month. Add social media on top of that foundation, not instead of it.
