**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for small business owners who do all their own marketing

---

**Body:**

I know the drill. You run the business, answer the phones, manage the team, AND somehow you are also supposed to write Facebook ads, post on Instagram, send emails, and figure out SEO. Hiring a marketing agency costs $2,000-5,000 per month. Hiring even a freelance copywriter is $150+ per project.

So I built something for the DIY marketer. It is a free Google Doc with 12 AI prompts you can paste into ChatGPT or Claude to handle the marketing tasks that normally take hours.

These are not generic prompts like "write me a social media post." Each one is engineered with a specific framework, a defined role for the AI, and variables you fill in with your business details. The output is something you can actually use -- not something you have to rewrite from scratch.

Here is what the 12 prompts cover:

- **Facebook ads** -- lead generation ads and community engagement posts
- **Instagram** -- product feature captions and 30-second Reel/TikTok scripts
- **Email** -- weekly newsletter format and lead magnet delivery
- **Website** -- above-the-fold homepage copy and lead magnet landing pages
- **Local SEO** -- Google Business Profile descriptions and how-to blog guides
- **Google ads** -- Shopping ad descriptions
- **Social media** -- launch day posts across 5 platforms simultaneously
- **Business** -- elevator pitches in 15, 30, and 60-second versions

Every prompt includes when to use it, the exact text to copy-paste, and the variables to swap in for your specific business.

No email required. No signup. Just the prompts.

I built these because I watched too many small business owners either overpay for mediocre marketing help or give up on marketing entirely. You do not need a marketing team -- you just need better tools. Let me know which prompts work best for your business.
