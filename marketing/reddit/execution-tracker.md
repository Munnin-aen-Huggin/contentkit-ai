## Rules and Guidelines

1. **7 days of value-add comments before posting the resource.** No exceptions.
2. **Never link to ContentKit in seed comments.** They must be genuine, helpful, standalone advice.
3. **Match the subreddit tone.** r/freelance is practical and direct. r/entrepreneur skews aspirational. r/copywriting is technically savvy. Adjust voice accordingly.
4. **Engage with replies.** If someone responds to a seed comment, reply within 24 hours with additional value. Build conversation threads.
5. **Monitor mod rules.** Check each subreddit's self-promotion policy before posting the resource. Some require mod approval for links.
6. **Space resource posts across subreddits.** Never post resource links in more than 2 subreddits on the same day.
7. **Use UTM links.** Every resource post link must include the correct UTM parameters from `tracking/utm-links.md`.
8. **Track everything.** Update this tracker daily during active rollout. Log links to every comment and post.
