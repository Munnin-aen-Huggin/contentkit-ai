Structure: opening hook (one strong statement or counterintuitive claim), main insight developed in 3-4 short paragraphs, one specific example, key takeaway, discussion question.

Feature 3: [FEATURE 3]. Feature 4: [FEATURE 4]. Feature 5: [FEATURE 5]. Format: "[Benefit] -- [brief feature explanation]." Each bullet under 20 words.

For each tier: tier name + badge (e.g., "Most Popular"), price + price qualifier, 1-sentence description of who it's for, 4-5 feature bullets (benefit format), and CTA button text. The higher tier should feel like a no-brainer upgrade, not just "more stuff."

**Variables to customize:**
- [TIER 1/2 NAME] -- e.g., "Starter" and "Full Kit"
- [PRICE 1/2] -- e.g., "$27" and "$47"
- [TIER FEATURES] -- list the actual features in each tier accurately

---

## Prompt 9: Blog Post Outline -- Keyword-Targeted Long-Form

Include: H1 title (keyword included), meta description (under 160 chars), intro paragraph purpose, 4-6 H2 sections with purpose and 2-3 H3 subsections each, FAQ section (3 questions), and closing CTA.

- [SEARCH INTENT] -- informational, commercial, transactional -- note which this keyword is

---

## Prompt 10: Pillar Content Structure -- Hub and Spoke Plan

Include: (1) pillar page title and target keyword, (2) 8 cluster content pieces -- each with a suggested title, target keyword, and its relationship to the pillar (supports, expands, or specializes), (3) internal linking strategy: how each cluster page links back to the pillar and to each other.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PILLAR TOPIC] -- your core content area
- [CLUSTER RELATIONSHIPS] -- each cluster piece should target a more specific keyword than the pillar

---

## Prompt 11: Brand Messaging Hierarchy

**When to use:** When creating a messaging framework that cascades from the brand level down to individual audience segments. A messaging hierarchy ensures consistency across all channels without making every message identical.

Level 2 -- Audience Segment Messages: 3 variations for [SEGMENT 1], [SEGMENT 2], [SEGMENT 3] -- same core idea, different language for each. Level 3 -- Channel-Specific Messages: adapt Level 2 messages for: website homepage, Facebook ad, email subject line. Format as a cascade table.

**Variables to customize:**
- [BRAND NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit"

---

## Prompt 12: Messaging Pillars -- 3-Pillar Framework

**When to use:** When defining the 3 core themes that all brand messaging returns to. Messaging pillars are the 3 things you always say, no matter the channel, audience, or format -- they create the consistency of a recognizable brand.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a messaging framework strategist. Define 3 messaging pillars for [BRAND NAME]. For each pillar: (1) pillar name (2-4 words), (2) core claim (1 sentence -- what this pillar asserts), (3) supporting proof points (3 facts, features, or results that back the claim), (4) how it shows up in copy (example headline, email subject, and social post each embodying this pillar). Format: 3 parallel blocks.

**Variables to customize:**
- [BRAND NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit"
- Pillars should be distinct -- no two pillars should overlap in meaning

---

- [LAUNCH MESSAGE] -- the one-sentence core announcement
- [URL] -- your product page URL

---

## Prompt 14: YouTube Video Hook -- 5 Variants (First 30 Seconds)

**When to use:** When writing or testing YouTube video hooks. The first 30 seconds determine viewer retention -- most viewers click away in the first 15 seconds if the hook doesn't hold them. This generates 5 different hook approaches to test.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a YouTube hook writer. Write 5 first-30-second hook scripts for a video about [TOPIC -- e.g., "how to write Facebook ads using AI"]. Each hook must: create pattern interruption, promise specific value, and set up the rest of the video. Types: (1) Question hook, (2) Shocking stat hook, (3) Challenge hook ("I bet you can't..."), (4) Story hook (open in the middle of the story), (5) Curiosity gap hook ("I discovered something that changed everything"). Each: 75-100 words, timestamped.

**Variables to customize:**
- [TOPIC] -- the specific video topic
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] -- who you're making this for

---

---

## Prompt 1: Pre-Launch Waitlist Landing Page

**When to use:** To build a pre-launch email list before your product goes live. Waitlist pages that reveal specifics (price, launch date, key features) convert better than vague "be the first to know" pages.

Include: (1) headline: what's coming and who it's for (under 12 words), (2) 3-sentence tease: enough specifics to create desire, not enough to satisfy it, (3) waitlist benefit: [EARLY BENEFIT -- e.g., "early access + $10 off launch price"], (4) email form: label + button text + privacy line. Under 200 words. Create genuine anticipation without overpromising.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a Product Hunt launch copywriter. Write the launch package for [PRODUCT NAME]: (1) Tagline (under 60 chars): what it does + for whom + result, (2) Description (under 260 chars): expand tagline with one specific detail, (3) First comment from maker (150-200 words): personal story of building it, who it's for, 3 things it does, what you'd love feedback on, genuine thanks. Tone: founder-to-community, honest, specific.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "InvoicePilot" or "ContentKit AI"
- [PERSONAL STORY] -- your actual motivation for building it
- [SPECIFIC DETAIL] -- a specific feature or number in the description

---

**When to use:** To announce launch across all social platforms simultaneously on day one. Each platform requires different length and format -- this prompt generates platform-native copy for all five.

**The Prompt:**

- [LAUNCH MESSAGE] -- the one-sentence core announcement
- [URL] -- your product page URL

---

## Prompt 4: Brand Positioning Statement

**When to use:** When defining or refining the foundational positioning of your brand. A positioning statement is internal strategy -- not customer-facing tagline copy. It anchors every other brand decision.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a brand strategist. Write a positioning statement for [BRAND NAME] using the classic format: "For [TARGET AUDIENCE], [BRAND NAME] is the [CATEGORY] that [UNIQUE VALUE] because [REASON TO BELIEVE]." Then: (1) expand it to a 2-paragraph positioning paragraph for internal use, (2) identify the primary competitor frame you're positioning against, (3) name the one thing you must be better at than anyone else in your category. Use this information: [BRAND/PRODUCT DETAILS].

**Variables to customize:**
- [BRAND NAME] -- e.g., "InvoicePilot"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] -- specific, not "everyone"
- [BRAND/PRODUCT DETAILS] -- describe your product, audience, differentiators

---

## Prompt 5: Brand Story (Origin Narrative)

**When to use:** To craft the founding story of your brand. A compelling brand story creates connection, trust, and memorability -- it answers why the brand exists in a way that resonates emotionally with the target audience.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a brand storytelling strategist. Write the brand story for [BRAND NAME] in three versions: (1) long version (300-400 words): full narrative -- the problem the founder faced, what they tried that didn't work, the moment of insight, and why [BRAND NAME] was built for buyers like them, (2) medium version (100-150 words): used on About page, (3) short version (25-35 words): used as elevator pitch or social bio. All three must be consistent in facts but calibrated in length.

**Variables to customize:**
- [BRAND NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit"
- [FOUNDER PROBLEM] -- the real situation that motivated creating the brand
- [INSIGHT MOMENT] -- the specific realization that led to the product

---

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a USP strategist. Develop the Unique Selling Proposition for [PRODUCT NAME]. Process: (1) list 8 potential differentiators (features, outcomes, model, price, experience), (2) score each on: is it important to buyers (1-5)? Is it unique to us (1-5)? Is it defensible (1-5)? (3) Highest total score = primary USP. (4) Write the USP in 3 formats: 10-word headline, 25-word statement, 50-word elevator pitch. Show the scoring.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- Be honest in the scoring -- inflated uniqueness scores lead to weak positioning

---

## Prompt 7: Sales Page -- Long-Form (Full Structure Outline)

**When to use:** As a master outline for writing a full long-form sales page. The outline defines every section in order with the purpose of each section and the copy type needed -- serving as a complete brief for writing.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PRICE POINT] -- e.g., "$47"
- Adjust section order based on your specific product category

---

## Prompt 8: Email -- Launch Announcement to Existing List

**When to use:** On launch day to your existing email list. These subscribers are warmer than cold traffic -- many have been waiting for the product. The launch announcement must create urgency without burning goodwill.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a launch email copywriter. Write a launch day announcement email to an existing email list for [PRODUCT NAME]. They've been on the list before the launch and may have seen teasers. Structure: (1) announce it's live with the direct link, (2) 3-bullet reminder of what's inside, (3) launch pricing and how long it lasts: [LAUNCH OFFER], (4) a genuine reason this specific list gets first access. CTA above the fold and again at the bottom. Under 250 words.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [LAUNCH OFFER] -- e.g., "launch price of $47 for this week only -- going to $67 after Sunday"
- [3 BULLETS] -- key product features or outcomes

---

## Prompt 9: Facebook Ad -- Story Format (Personal Narrative)

**When to use:** When you want to build connection and trust before the pitch. Story ads have lower immediate CTR but higher engagement and purchase rates from warm audiences. Best used after initial awareness campaigns.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a storytelling copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a personal narrative structure. Story: [CHARACTER -- e.g., "a freelancer"] faced [PROBLEM]. They tried [FAILED SOLUTION]. Then they found [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Result: [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]. Lesson: one sentence that makes the reader see themselves in the story.

**Variables to customize:**

- [SPECIFIC OUTCOME] -- e.g., "wrote an entire launch campaign in one afternoon"

---

## Prompt 10: Twitter/X Post -- Product Launch Announcement

**When to use:** For announcing a product launch on Twitter/X. Launch tweets perform best when they lead with the most interesting aspect of the product, not the product name.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a product launch tweet writer. Write 3 tweet variants announcing the launch of [PRODUCT NAME]. Variant 1: lead with the outcome/result. Variant 2: lead with the most surprising or unexpected feature. Variant 3: lead with the price or offer as the hook. Each tweet: under 280 characters. Include link placeholder [URL]. No hashtags unless naturally fitting.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [MOST INTERESTING FEATURE] -- e.g., "500 structured prompts for $47, no subscription"
- [URL] -- your actual product URL

---

## Prompt 11: VSL (Video Sales Letter) -- Full Script (7 minutes)

**When to use:** For a Video Sales Letter on a landing page or sales funnel. A VSL replaces written sales copy with a spoken script -- it works for audiences who prefer video over reading.

Structure: Hook/Problem (0-1 min), Agitation (1-2:30 min), Solution intro (2:30-3:30 min), Product demo/walkthrough (3:30-5 min), Social proof (5-5:45 min), Offer + guarantee (5:45-6:30 min), CTA (6:30-7 min). ~1,050 spoken words. Include [SLIDE NOTES] for any supporting visuals. Conversational spoken-word style -- not read-out loud marketing copy.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PRICE] -- e.g., "$47"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] -- buyer results to reference in the proof section

---

# 12 AI Prompts That Write Better Sales Copy Than Your Top Rep

**By ContentKit AI** | Free Resource

Your best sales rep knows how to open cold, handle objections, and close. But they can only write so many emails in a day. These 12 AI prompts give every rep on your team the ability to produce professional cold outreach, follow-up sequences, sales pages, video scripts, and objection-handling copy -- in minutes instead of hours. Copy them into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, fill in the variables, and start sending.

---

## Prompt 1: Cold Outreach Email -- B2B Prospecting (EM-16)

**When to use:** When your team needs to prospect at scale without sending the same generic template to every list. This prompt produces cold emails that lead with the prospect's problem, not your pitch.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a B2B cold email specialist. Write a cold outreach email for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting [TARGET COMPANY TYPE -- e.g., "marketing agencies with 5-15 employees"]. Subject line: reference something specific about their role or company type. Body (150 words max): (1) one sentence on who you are, (2) identify a specific problem they likely have, (3) one sentence on what [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] does about it, (4) one specific result or proof, (5) small ask: [ASK -- e.g., "Is this relevant to your team? Happy to send a sample."]. No pitch deck. No calendar link in the first email.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "our sales enablement platform for mid-market SaaS"
- [TARGET COMPANY TYPE] -- e.g., "B2B SaaS companies with 10-50 sales reps and no dedicated enablement team"
- [ASK] -- e.g., "Is this on your radar? Happy to share what we did for a similar team."

---

## Prompt 2: Cold Outreach Follow-Up Sequence (EM-17)

**When to use:** After the first cold email gets no response. Most replies come from follow-ups -- this gives you three follow-ups that each add new value instead of "just bumping this up."

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a cold email follow-up specialist. Write a 3-email follow-up sequence following a cold email for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Email 1 (Day 3): add one new piece of value -- a specific insight, stat, or result from a similar company type. Email 2 (Day 7): try a different angle -- address a different pain point than the original email. Email 3 (Day 14): polite final ask -- acknowledge this is the last email, make it easy to reply even with a "not now." Each email: under 100 words.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "our outbound automation platform"
- [NEW VALUE -- Email 1] -- e.g., "a team of 12 SDRs increased their reply rate from 3% to 11% after restructuring their sequences"
- [DIFFERENT PAIN -- Email 2] -- e.g., if original was about reply rates, try ramp time for new reps or pipeline consistency

---

## Prompt 3: LinkedIn InMail -- Cold Outreach (LI-03)

**When to use:** For LinkedIn Sponsored InMail or direct messages targeting prospects who match your ICP. InMail must feel personal -- mass-blast language kills response rates.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a LinkedIn InMail copywriter. Write a sponsored InMail for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] targeting [JOB TITLE -- e.g., "marketing consultants running their own practice"]. Subject line (60 chars max): make it feel personal and relevant. Body (300 words max): reference something specific about their role, identify the problem [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] solves for people in their position, describe the offer in 2 sentences, and make the ask: [SMALL ASK -- e.g., "Would it be useful?

- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "our pipeline management tool for sales teams"
- [JOB TITLE] -- e.g., "VP of Sales at B2B companies with 20-100 employees"

---

## Prompt 4: Nurture Email -- Case Study / Mini Story (EM-09)

**When to use:** For mid-funnel leads who've shown interest but haven't booked a demo or committed. Story-based emails build trust faster than feature lists.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a story-driven email writer. Write a nurture email featuring a mini case study for [PRODUCT NAME]. Character: [BUYER TYPE -- e.g., "a freelance marketer managing 4 client accounts"]. Problem they had. What they tried that didn't work. Discovery of [PRODUCT NAME]. One specific result. Lesson for the reader. Under 300 words. Soft CTA at end: invite reader to try [PRODUCT NAME] if they recognize themselves in the story.

---

## Prompt 5: Nurture Email -- Final Ask (EM-12)

**When to use:** After completing a successful engagement -- tax filing, advisory project, or year-end close. CPAs thrive on referrals, and this makes asking feel natural, not transactional.

> Act as a referral program email writer. Write an email to existing buyers of [PRODUCT NAME] asking for a referral. Tone: warm and appreciative. Structure: (1) brief appreciation for their purchase, (2) ask if they know someone who would benefit, (3) make sharing easy: provide a pre-written message they can forward or a link they can share, (4) optional incentive: [INCENTIVE -- e.g., "they get $5 off with your link" or "no incentive -- just asking"]. Under 200 words.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "your tax preparation and advisory work with [Firm Name]"
- [PRE-WRITTEN MESSAGE] -- e.g., "Hey -- I've been working with [Firm Name] for my business taxes and they've been great. Proactive, saved me money I didn't know I was leaving on the table. Here's their info if you need a CPA: [URL]"
- [INCENTIVE] -- e.g., "$50 credit toward next year's filing for each referral" or no incentive

Include: (1) short description (100 characters -- for directories with character limits), (2) medium description (300 characters), (3) full description (750 characters -- Google Business Profile limit).

## 8. r/copywriting — 10 AI Prompts That Make You a Faster Copywriter

# 10 AI Prompts That Make You a Faster Copywriter

**By ContentKit AI** | Free Resource

AI is not replacing copywriters. But copywriters who use AI well are replacing those who do not. These 10 prompts are built on the frameworks you already know -- PAS, AIDA, before/after, story-format, VSL structure -- and they turn AI into a first-draft machine that gives you something worth editing instead of starting from a blank page. Copy-paste into ChatGPT or Claude, fill in the variables, and cut your drafting time in half.

## Prompt 1: Facebook Ad -- AIDA Framework

**When to use:** For warm audiences who've shown interest in your category but haven't purchased. AIDA moves methodically from grabbing attention to building rational desire to driving action.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a conversion copywriter. Write an AIDA-framework Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. The attention hook must address [ATTENTION HOOK -- e.g., a surprising statistic or bold claim]. Interest section: explain what [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] does in one sentence. Desire section: list 3 specific benefits using "you" language. Action: one clear CTA sentence with urgency. Format: primary text (up to 150 words), headline (under 40 characters), and description (under 30 characters).

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit AI prompt pack"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] -- e.g., "small business owners running their own social media"
- [ATTENTION HOOK] -- e.g., "Most business owners waste 6 hours/week writing captions from scratch"

---

## Prompt 2: Facebook Ad -- Before/After Transformation

**When to use:** For products or services with a clear before/after outcome. Works especially well for productivity tools, courses, templates, and coaching. Visual contrast of states drives desire.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a transformation copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a before/after format. Before state: [BEFORE -- e.g., "spending 3 hours writing one email and second-guessing every word"]. After state: [AFTER -- e.g., "30-minute email that sounds like you on your best day"]. Bridge: [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] is what gets them from before to after. Include: how it works (one sentence), who it's for, and CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit AI Prompt Pack"
- [BEFORE] -- e.g., "staring at a blank Google Doc for 45 minutes before writing a single headline"
- [AFTER] -- e.g., "three headline variants ready to test before your first coffee gets cold"

---

## Prompt 3: Facebook Ad -- Story Format (Personal Narrative)

**When to use:** When you want to build connection and trust before the pitch. Story ads have lower immediate CTR but higher engagement and purchase rates from warm audiences.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a storytelling copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a personal narrative structure. Story: [CHARACTER -- e.g., "a freelancer"] faced [PROBLEM]. They tried [FAILED SOLUTION]. Then they found [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Result: [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]. Lesson: one sentence that makes the reader see themselves in the story. CTA: invite them to get the same result. Primary text 150-200 words. First-person or third-person voice: [VOICE].

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "a client's SaaS onboarding tool"
- [CHARACTER] -- e.g., "a freelance copywriter managing five retainer clients"
- [PROBLEM] -- e.g., "spending more time on research and first drafts than on the actual craft of writing"
- [FAILED SOLUTION] -- e.g., "tried using generic AI prompts and got output that sounded like a press release from 2005"
- [SPECIFIC OUTCOME] -- e.g., "cut first-draft time from 3 hours to 40 minutes per deliverable"

---

## Prompt 4: Sales Video Script (VSL) -- Full Structure

**When to use:** For a Video Sales Letter (VSL) on a landing page. VSLs typically replace the traditional long-form sales page copy or supplement it. A 5-10 minute VSL follows a specific structure that mirrors the written sales page.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a VSL scriptwriter. Write a 7-minute VSL outline and script for [PRODUCT NAME]. Structure: Hook (0-30 sec): problem statement that makes the viewer lean in. Agitation (0:30-2:00): develop the problem with 3 specific pain scenarios. Solution intro (2:00-3:00): introduce [PRODUCT NAME] and the mechanism.

---

## Prompt 5: Long-Form Sales Page -- Problem Section (Full)

**When to use:** For writing the complete problem/agitation section of a long-form sales page. The problem section is often the most under-written section -- it needs to make the reader feel deeply understood before you can sell to them.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a problem-section long-copy writer. Write a complete 300-word problem section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s sales page. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. The section must: name the situation specifically (not just the pain), describe the emotional cost (not just the practical cost), mention what they've already tried and why it didn't work, and end with a pivot sentence that opens the door to the solution. No solution mention yet.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] -- e.g., "freelance copywriters juggling multiple retainer clients"
- [WHAT THEY'VE TRIED] -- e.g., "swipe files / generic AI tools / outsourcing to junior writers"

---

## Prompt 6: Long-Form Sales Page -- Intro Story (Lead)

**When to use:** For the opening story/intro of a long-form sales page. The lead (first 200-300 words) determines whether someone reads the rest of the page -- it must hook immediately and set up the narrative frame for everything that follows.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a long-copy lead writer. Write a 300-word opening story/lead for [PRODUCT NAME]'s long-form sales page. Style: direct mail narrative format. Open with a specific scene the reader can picture. Develop the problem with detail. End with a curiosity-gap sentence that makes them want to continue reading ("But then I discovered something that changed everything..."). Character: [CHARACTER -- first person founder or second-person reader], Situation: [OPENING SCENE], Problem: [PROBLEM]. No product mention yet.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [CHARACTER] -- first-person (founder) or second-person (reader as protagonist)
- [OPENING SCENE] -- a specific, vivid scene that puts the reader in the moment
- [PROBLEM] -- the situation that creates the tension in the story

---

## Prompt 7: Closing CTA Section -- Bottom of Page

**When to use:** For the final CTA section at the bottom of a long-form sales page. At this point, the visitor has read everything -- this final section should be brief, confident, and close with a direct ask.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a closing section copywriter. Write the final CTA section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s sales page. The visitor has read the entire page -- they don't need more information, they need a clear final push. Include: (1) closing headline (2-4 words -- "Ready to start?" or "Your turn."), (2) 1-sentence recap of the offer (price + what's included), (3) final benefit statement (1 sentence -- the transformation), (4) guarantee reminder (1 sentence), (5) CTA button text.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit -- Full Kit"
- [OFFER RECAP] -- e.g., "$47 one-time -- 500+ prompts, 8 categories, instant download"
- [TRANSFORMATION] -- e.g., "start writing better marketing copy today"

---

## Prompt 8: Promotional Email -- Flash Sale

**When to use:** For a 48-72 hour flash sale to an existing email list. Primes buyers with a specific discount or bonus, creates urgency with a hard deadline.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a flash sale email copywriter. Write a flash sale announcement email for [PRODUCT NAME]. Sale details: [DISCOUNT OR BONUS -- e.g., "30% off" or "buy Full Kit, get email swipe file free"]. Duration: [DURATION -- e.g., "48 hours -- ends [DAY] at midnight"]. Structure: (1) announce the sale clearly in subject line and first line, (2) remind them what [PRODUCT NAME] is and does, (3) state the sale terms explicitly, (4) CTA with countdown language. Under 200 words. Subject line must include the sale term.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "The Copywriting Framework Pack"
- [DISCOUNT OR BONUS] -- e.g., "30% off -- $297 drops to $207"
- [DURATION] -- e.g., "48 hours -- ends Thursday at midnight EST"

## Prompt 9: Brand Messaging Hierarchy

**When to use:** When creating a messaging framework that cascades from the brand level down to individual audience segments. Essential for client work -- delivering a messaging hierarchy shows strategic thinking, not just wordsmithing.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a messaging strategist. Build a 3-level messaging hierarchy for [BRAND NAME]: Level 1 -- Core Brand Message: one sentence that communicates the essence of [BRAND NAME] for all audiences. Level 2 -- Audience Segment Messages: 3 variations for [SEGMENT 1], [SEGMENT 2], [SEGMENT 3] -- same core idea, different language for each. Level 3 -- Channel-Specific Messages: adapt Level 2 messages for: website homepage, Facebook ad, email subject line. Format as a cascade table.

**Variables to customize:**
- [BRAND NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit" or your client's brand name
- [SEGMENT 1/2/3] -- e.g., "freelancers / agency owners / solopreneurs"

---

## Prompt 10: VSL (Video Sales Letter) -- Full Script (7 minutes)

**When to use:** For a Video Sales Letter on a landing page or sales funnel. A VSL replaces written sales copy with a spoken script -- it works for audiences who prefer video over reading.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a VSL scriptwriter. Write a 7-minute VSL script for [PRODUCT NAME] at [PRICE]. Structure: Hook/Problem (0-1 min), Agitation (1-2:30 min), Solution intro (2:30-3:30 min), Product demo/walkthrough (3:30-5 min), Social proof (5-5:45 min), Offer + guarantee (5:45-6:30 min), CTA (6:30-7 min). ~1,050 spoken words. Include [SLIDE NOTES] for any supporting visuals. Conversational spoken-word style -- not read-out loud marketing copy.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "The Copywriting Intensive" or your client's product
- [PRICE] -- e.g., "$497"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] -- buyer results to reference in the proof section
