## Prompt 1: Pre-Launch Waitlist Landing Page

**When to use:** To build a pre-launch email list before your product goes live. Waitlist pages that reveal specifics (price, launch date, key features) convert better than vague "be the first to know" pages.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a pre-launch copywriter. Write a waitlist landing page for [PRODUCT NAME] launching on [DATE]. Include: (1) headline: what's coming and who it's for (under 12 words), (2) 3-sentence tease: enough specifics to create desire, not enough to satisfy it, (3) waitlist benefit: [EARLY BENEFIT -- e.g., "early access + $10 off launch price"], (4) email form: label + button text + privacy line. Under 200 words. Create genuine anticipation without overpromising.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "MarketingOS" or "DesignKit Pro"
- [DATE] -- specific launch date
- [EARLY BENEFIT] -- something genuinely valuable for signing up early

## Prompt 2: Product Hunt Launch Post

**When to use:** For your Product Hunt launch day. Product Hunt requires a tagline, description, and first comment from the maker. Getting upvotes in the first 2-3 hours determines the final ranking.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a Product Hunt launch copywriter. Write the launch package for [PRODUCT NAME]: (1) Tagline (under 60 chars): what it does + for whom + result, (2) Description (under 260 chars): expand tagline with one specific detail, (3) First comment from maker (150-200 words): personal story of building it, who it's for, 3 things it does, what you'd love feedback on, genuine thanks. Tone: founder-to-community, honest, specific.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "InvoicePilot" or "ContentKit AI"
- [PERSONAL STORY] -- your actual motivation for building it
- [SPECIFIC DETAIL] -- a specific feature or number in the description

## Prompt 3: Launch Day Social Posts -- 5-Platform Set

**When to use:** To announce launch across all social platforms simultaneously on day one. Each platform requires different length and format -- this prompt generates platform-native copy for all five.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a launch day social media writer. Write launch day posts for [PRODUCT NAME] across 5 platforms: (1) Twitter/X (under 280 chars + link), (2) LinkedIn (200-300 words, professional tone), (3) Instagram caption (under 150 words + 5 hashtags), (4) Facebook (150 words), (5) TikTok hook text (3 sentences for the caption). Each must feel native to the platform, not copy-pasted. Core message: [LAUNCH MESSAGE].

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [LAUNCH MESSAGE] -- the one-sentence core announcement
- [URL] -- your product page URL

---

## Prompt 4: Brand Positioning Statement

**When to use:** When defining or refining the foundational positioning of your brand. A positioning statement is internal strategy -- not customer-facing tagline copy. It anchors every other brand decision.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a brand strategist. Write a positioning statement for [BRAND NAME] using the classic format: "For [TARGET AUDIENCE], [BRAND NAME] is the [CATEGORY] that [UNIQUE VALUE] because [REASON TO BELIEVE]." Then: (1) expand it to a 2-paragraph positioning paragraph for internal use, (2) identify the primary competitor frame you're positioning against, (3) name the one thing you must be better at than anyone else in your category. Use this information: [BRAND/PRODUCT DETAILS].

**Variables to customize:**
- [BRAND NAME] -- e.g., "InvoicePilot"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] -- specific, not "everyone"
- [BRAND/PRODUCT DETAILS] -- describe your product, audience, differentiators

---

## Prompt 5: Brand Story (Origin Narrative)

**When to use:** To craft the founding story of your brand. A compelling brand story creates connection, trust, and memorability -- it answers why the brand exists in a way that resonates emotionally with the target audience.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a brand storytelling strategist. Write the brand story for [BRAND NAME] in three versions: (1) long version (300-400 words): full narrative -- the problem the founder faced, what they tried that didn't work, the moment of insight, and why [BRAND NAME] was built for buyers like them, (2) medium version (100-150 words): used on About page, (3) short version (25-35 words): used as elevator pitch or social bio. All three must be consistent in facts but calibrated in length.

**Variables to customize:**
- [BRAND NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit"
- [FOUNDER PROBLEM] -- the real situation that motivated creating the brand
- [INSIGHT MOMENT] -- the specific realization that led to the product

## Prompt 6: Unique Selling Proposition (USP) Development

**When to use:** To develop and sharpen the Unique Selling Proposition -- the one reason buyers should choose you over all alternatives. A true USP is verifiable, specific, and important to the buyer.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a USP strategist. Develop the Unique Selling Proposition for [PRODUCT NAME]. Process: (1) list 8 potential differentiators (features, outcomes, model, price, experience), (2) score each on: is it important to buyers (1-5)? Is it unique to us (1-5)? Is it defensible (1-5)? (3) Highest total score = primary USP. (4) Write the USP in 3 formats: 10-word headline, 25-word statement, 50-word elevator pitch. Show the scoring.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- Be honest in the scoring -- inflated uniqueness scores lead to weak positioning

## Prompt 7: Sales Page -- Long-Form (Full Structure Outline)

**When to use:** As a master outline for writing a full long-form sales page. The outline defines every section in order with the purpose of each section and the copy type needed -- serving as a complete brief for writing.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a sales page architect. Write a complete long-form sales page outline for [PRODUCT NAME] at [PRICE POINT]. Include every section in order with: section name, psychological purpose (what it does for the reader), copy type needed, and word count target. Sections to include: above-fold, problem, solution, product details, social proof, FAQ, guarantee, pricing, closing CTA. Total page: 1,000-1,500 words. Include optional and required sections.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PRICE POINT] -- e.g., "$47"
- Adjust section order based on your specific product category

---

## Prompt 8: Email -- Launch Announcement to Existing List

**When to use:** On launch day to your existing email list. These subscribers are warmer than cold traffic -- many have been waiting for the product. The launch announcement must create urgency without burning goodwill.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a launch email copywriter. Write a launch day announcement email to an existing email list for [PRODUCT NAME]. They've been on the list before the launch and may have seen teasers. Structure: (1) announce it's live with the direct link, (2) 3-bullet reminder of what's inside, (3) launch pricing and how long it lasts: [LAUNCH OFFER], (4) a genuine reason this specific list gets first access. CTA above the fold and again at the bottom. Under 250 words.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [LAUNCH OFFER] -- e.g., "launch price of $47 for this week only -- going to $67 after Sunday"
- [3 BULLETS] -- key product features or outcomes

---

## Prompt 9: Facebook Ad -- Story Format (Personal Narrative)

**When to use:** When you want to build connection and trust before the pitch. Story ads have lower immediate CTR but higher engagement and purchase rates from warm audiences. Best used after initial awareness campaigns.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a storytelling copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a personal narrative structure. Story: [CHARACTER -- e.g., "a freelancer"] faced [PROBLEM]. They tried [FAILED SOLUTION]. Then they found [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Result: [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]. Lesson: one sentence that makes the reader see themselves in the story. CTA: invite them to get the same result. Primary text 150-200 words. First-person or third-person voice: [VOICE].

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "InvoicePilot"
- [CHARACTER] -- e.g., "a bootstrapped founder managing three side projects"
- [PROBLEM] -- e.g., "spending Sunday nights writing marketing copy instead of building product"
- [FAILED SOLUTION] -- e.g., "hired a freelancer who delivered generic copy after two weeks"
- [SPECIFIC OUTCOME] -- e.g., "wrote an entire launch campaign in one afternoon"

---

## Prompt 10: Twitter/X Post -- Product Launch Announcement

**When to use:** For announcing a product launch on Twitter/X. Launch tweets perform best when they lead with the most interesting aspect of the product, not the product name.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a product launch tweet writer. Write 3 tweet variants announcing the launch of [PRODUCT NAME]. Variant 1: lead with the outcome/result. Variant 2: lead with the most surprising or unexpected feature. Variant 3: lead with the price or offer as the hook. Each tweet: under 280 characters. Include link placeholder [URL]. No hashtags unless naturally fitting.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [MOST INTERESTING FEATURE] -- e.g., "500 structured prompts for $47, no subscription"
- [URL] -- your actual product URL

---

## Prompt 11: VSL (Video Sales Letter) -- Full Script (7 minutes)

**When to use:** For a Video Sales Letter on a landing page or sales funnel. A VSL replaces written sales copy with a spoken script -- it works for audiences who prefer video over reading.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a VSL scriptwriter. Write a 7-minute VSL script for [PRODUCT NAME] at [PRICE]. Structure: Hook/Problem (0-1 min), Agitation (1-2:30 min), Solution intro (2:30-3:30 min), Product demo/walkthrough (3:30-5 min), Social proof (5-5:45 min), Offer + guarantee (5:45-6:30 min), CTA (6:30-7 min). ~1,050 spoken words. Include [SLIDE NOTES] for any supporting visuals. Conversational spoken-word style -- not read-out loud marketing copy.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [PRICE] -- e.g., "$47"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] -- buyer results to reference in the proof section

---

**When to use:** Google Performance Max campaigns require a full asset set: headlines, descriptions, long headlines, and business name. This prompt generates a complete, campaign-ready asset set.

**The Prompt:**

(3) 4 descriptions, max 90 characters each. (4) Business name (max 25 characters). Target search intent: [SEARCH INTENT -- e.g., "people searching for AI copywriting tools"].
