## Comment 1

**Hypothetical thread title:** "How do you get your first 100 customers without a marketing budget?"

**Comment:**

Forget about scale for now. Your first 100 customers are not coming from ads, funnels, or viral content. They are coming from conversations.

Here is the playbook that has worked for multiple bootstrapped products I have seen launch successfully. First, find 10 online communities where your target customer hangs out -- subreddits, Facebook groups, Slack communities, Discord servers, indie hacker forums. Lurk for a week. Learn what they complain about, what they ask for help with, what tools they already use.

Then start helping. Answer questions. Share frameworks. Give specific advice. Do this for two to three weeks before you ever mention your product. When you do mention it, do it in context -- "I actually built something for this exact problem" -- not as a cold pitch.

Second, reach out to 50 people individually. DM them, email them, comment on their posts. Offer early access or a discount in exchange for honest feedback. Your first 100 customers are also your first 100 feedback loops. Their input shapes the product more than any market research ever will.

Paid acquisition comes later. Your first 100 come from hustle and genuine helpfulness.

**Hypothetical thread title:** "What's the best way to validate a product idea before building it?"

**Comment:**

The best validation is someone paying you money. Everything else -- surveys, landing page signups, people saying "I would totally buy that" -- is unreliable.

Here is the fastest validation framework. Step one: write a one-paragraph product description. What it does, who it is for, what the outcome is, and a price. Step two: build a simple landing page with that description, a price, and a "buy now" or "join waitlist" button. You can do this in an afternoon with Carrd or a simple Notion page. Step three: share it in three to five communities where your target customer exists. Not as an ad -- share it as "I am building this and want to know if it solves a real problem."

If people give you their email or pre-order, you have validation. If they say "cool idea" but do not sign up, you do not. The number that matters is not how many people liked your post -- it is how many people took an action that costs them something, even if that something is just their email address.

Do this before writing a single line of code or designing a single screen. A week of validation saves months of building something nobody wants.

**Hypothetical thread title:** "How important is branding for a startup? Or should I just focus on the product?"

**Comment:**

Branding at the early stage is not about logos, color palettes, or brand guidelines. It is about positioning -- knowing exactly who you are for and why they should pick you over the alternatives.

You need three things before you need a brand designer. First, a one-sentence positioning statement: "For [specific audience], [your product] is the [category] that [does this differently]." This sentence should make half the market say "that is not for me" and the other half say "that is exactly what I need." If it appeals to everyone, it is too vague.

Second, a consistent voice. Pick three adjectives that describe how your brand communicates -- for example, direct, practical, and approachable. Use those as a filter for every piece of copy you write. This costs nothing and takes 30 minutes to decide.

Third, a clear origin story. Why did you build this? What problem did you personally experience? Founders who can answer this in two sentences connect with early adopters faster than any logo ever will.

The visual branding can come later when you have revenue. But the strategic branding -- positioning, voice, and story -- should come before your first launch. It shapes everything from your landing page to your first tweet.
