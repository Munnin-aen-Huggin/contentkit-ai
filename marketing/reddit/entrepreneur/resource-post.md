**Title:** I made a free prompt kit for bootstrapped founders who handle their own marketing

---

**Body:**

When I started building my product, the marketing was the bottleneck. Not the code. Not the design. The marketing.

Writing a landing page took two days. Drafting launch emails took an afternoon. Coming up with social posts for five platforms took another morning. And the worst part was that after all that time, the output was mediocre -- because I am a builder, not a copywriter.

So I started engineering structured AI prompts that produce specific marketing outputs. Not "write me an ad" -- that gives you garbage. I mean prompts with a defined copywriting framework, a specific role for the AI, and clear variables you fill in for your product. The difference in output quality is night and day.

I pulled 12 of the most founder-relevant prompts into a free Google Doc. These are the ones that matter most when you are going from zero to first customers:

- **Pre-launch** -- waitlist landing page copy and Product Hunt launch posts
- **Launch day** -- multi-platform social posts, launch emails to your list, story-format Facebook ads, and product launch tweets
- **Brand building** -- positioning statements, brand origin stories, and USP development
- **Sales** -- long-form sales page outlines and 7-minute VSL scripts
- **Paid acquisition** -- Google Performance Max asset sets

Each prompt includes context for when to use it, the full prompt text, and the variables you swap in for your specific product.

Here is the doc: [GOOGLE_DOC_URL_FOR_ENTREPRENEUR]

No email gate. No pitch. Just the prompts.

I built these because every bootstrapped founder I know faces the same problem -- you can build the product, but marketing it solo is a completely different skill set. These prompts do not replace marketing thinking, but they eliminate the blank page and give you a strong first draft in minutes.

Would love to hear which prompts are most useful for your stage. Happy to answer questions.
