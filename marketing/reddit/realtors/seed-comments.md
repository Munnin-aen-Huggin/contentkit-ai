## Comment 1

**Thread title:** "How are you guys generating leads that aren't from Zillow or Realtor.com?"

**Comment:**

The best lead source I've found outside the portals is hyper-local content marketing. Not generic "5 tips for home buyers" blog posts -- actual neighborhood-specific content that ranks on Google when someone searches "best neighborhoods in [your city] for families" or "moving to [your area] guide."

I write one long-form blog post per month targeting a specific local keyword. Each post covers a single neighborhood or topic in real depth -- school ratings, price ranges, walkability, the stuff people actually want to know before they relocate. Over time, these posts compound. I'm getting 15-20 organic leads per month from posts I wrote over a year ago.

The key is specificity. "Real estate in Austin" is too broad. "Best neighborhoods in South Austin for young families under $500K" is a post that matches exactly what someone types into Google. Those leads are high intent because they're already researching your market. They just need an agent who clearly knows the area.

It takes 3-6 months to build momentum, but the leads are free and they already trust you because you taught them something useful.

**Thread title:** "What do you put in your listing descriptions that actually makes a difference?"

**Comment:**

The biggest mistake I see in listing descriptions is leading with specs. "Beautiful 4-bedroom, 3-bath home with open floor plan" describes 80% of listings on the market. It's invisible.

What works is leading with the lifestyle outcome, not the feature list. Instead of "renovated kitchen with quartz countertops," try "the kitchen where Saturday morning pancakes actually happen -- 12-foot island, quartz tops, and a window that looks out over the backyard."

I structure mine in three parts: open with the emotional hook (what it feels like to live there), then the key differentiators (what makes this house different from the 15 others in the same price range), and close with the practical details (beds, baths, sqft, lot size, school district).

The emotional hook is what makes someone click "Schedule Tour" instead of scrolling to the next listing. Specs confirm the decision. They don't make it. Spend 80% of your writing effort on the first two sentences and you'll see a measurable difference in showing requests.

**Thread title:** "Follow-up emails -- how often is too often after a showing?"

**Comment:**

The frequency matters less than the content. If every follow-up email is "Just checking in! Still interested?" -- once is too often. If every email adds something new and useful, you can follow up weekly without being annoying.

My sequence after a showing: Day 1 -- a brief personal note referencing something specific they said about the property (not a form email). Day 3 -- send them a comparable that just hit the market or a price change on something similar, with one sentence of context. Day 7 -- share a neighborhood insight: a new restaurant opening nearby, school ratings, commute data. Day 14 -- honest check-in acknowledging the timeline.

Each email gives them a reason to open it beyond "this agent wants my commission." The agents who struggle with follow-up are usually sending the same "touching base" email on repeat. Leads go cold because there's nothing new to engage with.

One more thing: never follow up with "Are you still looking?" Ask a specific question instead, like "Did you end up visiting that open house on Elm Street?" Specific questions get specific answers. Generic questions get ignored.
