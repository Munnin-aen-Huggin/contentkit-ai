**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for agents who know they need better marketing but don't have a marketing team

**Body:**

I've been working on AI-powered marketing systems for a while, and I kept running into the same pattern with real estate agents: you know you need better listing descriptions, follow-up emails, social media content, and local SEO -- but you don't have 10 hours a week to produce it, and hiring a marketing person at $3-5K/month doesn't make sense for most solo agents or small teams.

So I put together a free guide with 12 structured AI prompts built specifically for real estate marketing. These aren't generic "write me a listing description" prompts -- each one has a specific framework, word count targets, and variables you fill in for your market and listings.

Here's what's covered:

- **Listing descriptions** that lead with lifestyle, not just specs
- **Follow-up emails** -- story-based nurture emails that give leads a reason to reply, plus a referral request template for past clients
- **Social media content** -- Instagram captions and Facebook community posts designed for local engagement
- **Local SEO** -- location-targeted page descriptions and business listing copy for Google Business, Yelp, and directories
- **Google Ads** -- keyword-matched ad copy variants for your market
- **LinkedIn content** -- trend commentary posts that attract referral partners and relocation clients
- **Video scripts** -- property tour scripts with a result-first structure
- **Email newsletters** -- a weekly template that keeps your sphere of influence engaged
- **Blog content** -- SEO listicle outlines for "best neighborhoods" type posts that drive organic leads

Every prompt is copy-paste ready. I use these in my own work and they've dramatically cut the time it takes to produce professional marketing content.

No email required, no signup wall. Just the prompts.

Would love to hear which ones resonate with your business. Happy to answer any questions about how to customize them for your specific market.
