## Comment 1

**Hypothetical thread title:** "How do you use AI without it making all your copy sound the same?"

**Comment:**

The reason most AI copy sounds identical is because most people give it identical prompts. "Write me a sales email" gives you the same output as everyone else who typed "write me a sales email." The AI is not the bottleneck -- your brief is.

Two things fix this immediately. First, give the AI a specific copywriting framework. Do not say "write an ad." Say "write an ad using PAS structure -- open with a specific pain my audience recognizes, spend two sentences amplifying the cost of that pain, then position my product as the solution." When the AI has structural constraints, the output sounds like intentional copywriting, not filler.

Second, feed it your voice. Paste in two or three paragraphs of your existing copy and tell it to match that tone. Say "match the rhythm and vocabulary of this sample -- short sentences, no corporate language, contractions allowed." The AI adapts surprisingly well when you give it something real to anchor to.

AI copy still needs editing. But the difference between a 20-minute edit on a structured first draft and a 3-hour blank-page writing session is the difference between billing more and burning out.

## Comment 2

**Hypothetical thread title:** "What's the best framework for writing landing pages? I keep getting stuck on structure."

**Comment:**

The framework depends on traffic temperature, but here is the one that works for most direct-response landing pages.

Above the fold: outcome-focused headline (under 10 words), subheadline that clarifies who it is for and how it works, three proof signals (buyer count, star rating, guarantee), and a CTA. This section has one job -- earn the scroll.

Problem section: five to seven pain point bullets that make the reader feel understood. Each bullet should describe a specific situation, not a vague frustration. "Spending Sunday nights rewriting the same email for the third time" beats "struggling with email marketing."

Solution section: what changes when they use your product. Three outcome bullets in "now you can" format. Then a brief description of what is literally inside the product.

Social proof section: do not just say "testimonials." Frame them with a header that references a specific result or customer count.

FAQ section: write eight questions, each one addressing a real objection -- pricing, fit, guarantee, comparison to free alternatives, time investment, and who this is not for.

Closing CTA: brief. Headline, one-sentence offer recap, benefit statement, guarantee, button.

The key is that every section has one psychological job. Problem creates identification. Solution creates desire. Proof creates trust. CTA creates action. If a section is not doing its job, cut it.

## Comment 3

**Hypothetical thread title:** "How do you write a VSL script? I've never done video copy before."

**Comment:**

A VSL (Video Sales Letter) follows the same structure as a long-form sales page, but written for the ear instead of the eye. The biggest mistake copywriters make with their first VSL is writing it like a blog post that someone reads out loud. It should sound like someone talking to a friend at a coffee shop about a problem they solved.

The standard structure for a 7-minute VSL is: Hook (0-1 minute) -- one specific problem statement that makes the viewer lean in. Agitation (1-2.5 minutes) -- three pain scenarios that make the problem feel urgent and personal. Solution intro (2.5-3.5 minutes) -- introduce the product and the mechanism. Demo or walkthrough (3.5-5 minutes) -- show what is inside, step by step. Social proof (5-5.45 minutes) -- buyer results. Offer and guarantee (5.45-6.5 minutes). CTA (6.5-7 minutes).

Write it at about 150 words per minute of spoken word. Use short sentences. Read it out loud as you write -- if you stumble on a sentence, rewrite it. The conversational tone is what separates a VSL that converts from a VSL that sounds like a corporate training video.
