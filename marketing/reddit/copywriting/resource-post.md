**Title:** I made a free prompt sheet for copywriters who use AI to speed up first drafts

---

**Body:**

I am a copywriter. I use AI every day. Not to replace the craft -- to skip the blank page and get to the editing phase faster.

The problem with most AI prompts is they produce generic output because they lack the structure that makes good copy work. When you tell ChatGPT "write me a Facebook ad," you get something that sounds like it was written by a committee. But when you give it a specific framework -- AIDA, PAS, before/after, story-format -- and define the role, audience, and variables, the output jumps to a quality level where editing is actually productive instead of a rewrite.

I compiled 10 of these prompts into a free Google Doc, focused specifically on the frameworks copywriters use daily:

- **Ad frameworks** -- AIDA-structure Facebook ads, before/after transformation ads, story-format narrative ads
- **Long-form sales copy** -- VSL script structure (full 7-minute outline), problem section agitation, intro story lead, closing CTA sections
- **Sales page architecture** -- complete VSL outline with timestamps and section purposes
- **Strategic deliverables** -- messaging hierarchy frameworks that make you look like a strategist, not just a writer
- **Emails** -- flash sale copy with countdown structure

Each prompt includes context for when to use it, the full prompt you copy-paste, and variables you customize per client.

No email gate. No funnel. Just the prompts.

I built these because the conversation around "AI vs. copywriters" misses the point entirely. The copywriters who are winning right now are the ones who use AI for the 80% that is structural -- first drafts, variant generation, framework application -- and spend their time on the 20% that is actually craft: voice, strategy, and the edits that turn good copy into great copy.

These prompts handle the structural 80%. You bring the other 20%.

Curious which frameworks you use most in your workflow -- happy to discuss in comments.
