# 10 AI Prompts That Make You a Faster Copywriter

**By ContentKit AI** | Free Resource

AI is not replacing copywriters. But copywriters who use AI well are replacing those who do not. These 10 prompts are built on the frameworks you already know -- PAS, AIDA, before/after, story-format, VSL structure -- and they turn AI into a first-draft machine that gives you something worth editing instead of starting from a blank page. Copy-paste into ChatGPT or Claude, fill in the variables, and cut your drafting time in half.

## Prompt 1: Facebook Ad -- AIDA Framework

**When to use:** For warm audiences who've shown interest in your category but haven't purchased. AIDA moves methodically from grabbing attention to building rational desire to driving action.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a conversion copywriter. Write an AIDA-framework Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. The attention hook must address [ATTENTION HOOK -- e.g., a surprising statistic or bold claim]. Interest section: explain what [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] does in one sentence. Desire section: list 3 specific benefits using "you" language. Action: one clear CTA sentence with urgency. Format: primary text (up to 150 words), headline (under 40 characters), and description (under 30 characters).

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit AI prompt pack"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] -- e.g., "small business owners running their own social media"
- [ATTENTION HOOK] -- e.g., "Most business owners waste 6 hours/week writing captions from scratch"

## Prompt 2: Facebook Ad -- Before/After Transformation

**When to use:** For products or services with a clear before/after outcome. Works especially well for productivity tools, courses, templates, and coaching. Visual contrast of states drives desire.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a transformation copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a before/after format. Before state: [BEFORE -- e.g., "spending 3 hours writing one email and second-guessing every word"]. After state: [AFTER -- e.g., "30-minute email that sounds like you on your best day"]. Bridge: [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] is what gets them from before to after. Include: how it works (one sentence), who it's for, and CTA. Primary text under 125 words.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit AI Prompt Pack"
- [BEFORE] -- e.g., "staring at a blank Google Doc for 45 minutes before writing a single headline"
- [AFTER] -- e.g., "three headline variants ready to test before your first coffee gets cold"

## Prompt 3: Facebook Ad -- Story Format (Personal Narrative)

**When to use:** When you want to build connection and trust before the pitch. Story ads have lower immediate CTR but higher engagement and purchase rates from warm audiences.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a storytelling copywriter. Write a Facebook ad for [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] using a personal narrative structure. Story: [CHARACTER -- e.g., "a freelancer"] faced [PROBLEM]. They tried [FAILED SOLUTION]. Then they found [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]. Result: [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]. Lesson: one sentence that makes the reader see themselves in the story. CTA: invite them to get the same result. Primary text 150-200 words. First-person or third-person voice: [VOICE].

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME] -- e.g., "a client's SaaS onboarding tool"
- [CHARACTER] -- e.g., "a freelance copywriter managing five retainer clients"
- [PROBLEM] -- e.g., "spending more time on research and first drafts than on the actual craft of writing"
- [FAILED SOLUTION] -- e.g., "tried using generic AI prompts and got output that sounded like a press release from 2005"
- [SPECIFIC OUTCOME] -- e.g., "cut first-draft time from 3 hours to 40 minutes per deliverable"

## Prompt 4: Sales Video Script (VSL) -- Full Structure

**When to use:** For a Video Sales Letter (VSL) on a landing page. VSLs typically replace the traditional long-form sales page copy or supplement it. A 5-10 minute VSL follows a specific structure that mirrors the written sales page.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a VSL scriptwriter. Write a 7-minute VSL outline and script for [PRODUCT NAME]. Structure: Hook (0-30 sec): problem statement that makes the viewer lean in. Agitation (0:30-2:00): develop the problem with 3 specific pain scenarios. Solution intro (2:00-3:00): introduce [PRODUCT NAME] and the mechanism. Proof (3:00-4:30): 3 buyer results, product demonstration summary. Offer (4:30-5:30): what's included, price, bonuses. Guarantee (5:30-6:00). CTA (6:00-7:00). Approximate word count per section included.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"

- [3 BUYER RESULTS] -- real or representative customer outcomes

---

## Prompt 5: Long-Form Sales Page -- Problem Section (Full)

**When to use:** For writing the complete problem/agitation section of a long-form sales page. The problem section is often the most under-written section -- it needs to make the reader feel deeply understood before you can sell to them.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a problem-section long-copy writer. Write a complete 300-word problem section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s sales page. Target: [TARGET AUDIENCE]. The section must: name the situation specifically (not just the pain), describe the emotional cost (not just the practical cost), mention what they've already tried and why it didn't work, and end with a pivot sentence that opens the door to the solution. No solution mention yet.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] -- e.g., "freelance copywriters juggling multiple retainer clients"
- [WHAT THEY'VE TRIED] -- e.g., "swipe files / generic AI tools / outsourcing to junior writers"

## Prompt 6: Long-Form Sales Page -- Intro Story (Lead)

**When to use:** For the opening story/intro of a long-form sales page. The lead (first 200-300 words) determines whether someone reads the rest of the page -- it must hook immediately and set up the narrative frame for everything that follows.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a long-copy lead writer. Write a 300-word opening story/lead for [PRODUCT NAME]'s long-form sales page. Style: direct mail narrative format. Open with a specific scene the reader can picture. Develop the problem with detail. End with a curiosity-gap sentence that makes them want to continue reading ("But then I discovered something that changed everything..."). Character: [CHARACTER -- first person founder or second-person reader], Situation: [OPENING SCENE], Problem: [PROBLEM]. No product mention yet.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit"
- [CHARACTER] -- first-person (founder) or second-person (reader as protagonist)
- [OPENING SCENE] -- a specific, vivid scene that puts the reader in the moment
- [PROBLEM] -- the situation that creates the tension in the story

---

## Prompt 7: Closing CTA Section -- Bottom of Page

**When to use:** For the final CTA section at the bottom of a long-form sales page. At this point, the visitor has read everything -- this final section should be brief, confident, and close with a direct ask.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a closing section copywriter. Write the final CTA section for [PRODUCT NAME]'s sales page. The visitor has read the entire page -- they don't need more information, they need a clear final push. Include: (1) closing headline (2-4 words -- "Ready to start?" or "Your turn."), (2) 1-sentence recap of the offer (price + what's included), (3) final benefit statement (1 sentence -- the transformation), (4) guarantee reminder (1 sentence), (5) CTA button text.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "AI Marketing Prompt Kit -- Full Kit"
- [OFFER RECAP] -- e.g., "$47 one-time -- 500+ prompts, 8 categories, instant download"
- [TRANSFORMATION] -- e.g., "start writing better marketing copy today"

---

## Prompt 8: Promotional Email -- Flash Sale

**When to use:** For a 48-72 hour flash sale to an existing email list. Primes buyers with a specific discount or bonus, creates urgency with a hard deadline.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a flash sale email copywriter. Write a flash sale announcement email for [PRODUCT NAME]. Sale details: [DISCOUNT OR BONUS -- e.g., "30% off" or "buy Full Kit, get email swipe file free"]. Duration: [DURATION -- e.g., "48 hours -- ends [DAY] at midnight"]. Structure: (1) announce the sale clearly in subject line and first line, (2) remind them what [PRODUCT NAME] is and does, (3) state the sale terms explicitly, (4) CTA with countdown language. Under 200 words. Subject line must include the sale term.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "The Copywriting Framework Pack"
- [DISCOUNT OR BONUS] -- e.g., "30% off -- $297 drops to $207"
- [DURATION] -- e.g., "48 hours -- ends Thursday at midnight EST"

## Prompt 9: Brand Messaging Hierarchy

**When to use:** When creating a messaging framework that cascades from the brand level down to individual audience segments. Essential for client work -- delivering a messaging hierarchy shows strategic thinking, not just wordsmithing.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a messaging strategist. Build a 3-level messaging hierarchy for [BRAND NAME]: Level 1 -- Core Brand Message: one sentence that communicates the essence of [BRAND NAME] for all audiences. Level 2 -- Audience Segment Messages: 3 variations for [SEGMENT 1], [SEGMENT 2], [SEGMENT 3] -- same core idea, different language for each. Level 3 -- Channel-Specific Messages: adapt Level 2 messages for: website homepage, Facebook ad, email subject line. Format as a cascade table.

**Variables to customize:**
- [BRAND NAME] -- e.g., "ContentKit" or your client's brand name
- [SEGMENT 1/2/3] -- e.g., "freelancers / agency owners / solopreneurs"

---

## Prompt 10: VSL (Video Sales Letter) -- Full Script (7 minutes)

**When to use:** For a Video Sales Letter on a landing page or sales funnel. A VSL replaces written sales copy with a spoken script -- it works for audiences who prefer video over reading.

**The Prompt:**
> Act as a VSL scriptwriter. Write a 7-minute VSL script for [PRODUCT NAME] at [PRICE]. Structure: Hook/Problem (0-1 min), Agitation (1-2:30 min), Solution intro (2:30-3:30 min), Product demo/walkthrough (3:30-5 min), Social proof (5-5:45 min), Offer + guarantee (5:45-6:30 min), CTA (6:30-7 min). ~1,050 spoken words. Include [SLIDE NOTES] for any supporting visuals. Conversational spoken-word style -- not read-out loud marketing copy.

**Variables to customize:**
- [PRODUCT NAME] -- e.g., "The Copywriting Intensive" or your client's product
- [PRICE] -- e.g., "$497"
- [SOCIAL PROOF] -- buyer results to reference in the proof section
