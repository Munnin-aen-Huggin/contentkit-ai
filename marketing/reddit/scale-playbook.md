## Subreddit Selection Criteria

Before entering a new subreddit, evaluate it against all five criteria. A subreddit must pass at least 4 of 5 to be worth the time investment.

### 1. Minimum Subscribers
- **Threshold:** 25,000+ members
- **Why:** Below 25K, the subreddit is too small to generate meaningful traffic. Posts die quickly and comment karma accumulates slowly.
- **Exception:** Niche subreddits with extremely high purchase intent (e.g., a subreddit specifically for solopreneurs buying digital products) can be worth it at 10K+.

### 2. Relevance Score (1-5)
Rate how closely the subreddit audience overlaps with ContentKit's ideal buyer.

| Score | Definition | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 5 | Direct overlap -- members actively need marketing prompts | r/marketing, r/copywriting |
| 4 | Strong overlap -- members do marketing as part of their work | r/freelance, r/smallbusiness |
| 3 | Moderate overlap -- some members need marketing help | r/entrepreneur, r/startup |
| 2 | Weak overlap -- marketing is adjacent to their core need | r/webdev, r/graphic_design |
| 1 | Minimal overlap -- too far from the product | r/personalfinance, r/productivity |

**Minimum score to proceed:** 3

### 3. Competition Check
- Search the subreddit for "AI prompts," "marketing prompts," "ChatGPT marketing," and "AI copywriting."
- **Green light:** Few or no similar products being promoted. Community discusses AI tools but no one is offering structured prompt kits.
- **Yellow light:** Some AI tool mentions but no direct competitors selling prompt packs. Proceed with caution.
- **Red light:** Active competitors already promoting similar products. The community may be fatigued. Skip or delay.

### 4. Mod Rules Review
Check the subreddit rules for:
- [ ] Self-promotion policy -- is promotional content allowed at all?
- [ ] Link posting rules -- are direct links permitted in posts?
- [ ] Account age / karma requirements -- do you meet the minimum?
- [ ] Flair requirements -- do posts need specific flair?
- [ ] Frequency limits -- how often can you post?

**If self-promotion is banned entirely:** Focus on seed comments only. Build karma and credibility. Link only in your Reddit profile bio.
**If self-promotion is allowed with conditions:** Follow the conditions exactly. Usually this means a ratio of value posts to promotional posts (e.g., 10:1).

### 5. Activity Level
- Check the front page: are posts from the last 24-48 hours getting 10+ upvotes?
- Check new posts: are there 5+ new posts per day?
- **Dead subreddits** (fewer than 2 posts/day, top posts have <5 upvotes) are not worth the time investment regardless of subscriber count.

## Expansion Targets

These subreddits have been pre-evaluated as potential Batch 3+ candidates.

| Subreddit | Subscribers (approx.) | Relevance | Competition | Mod Rules | Activity | Verdict |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| r/digitalmarketing | 200K+ | 5 | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [EVALUATE] |
| r/socialmedia | 300K+ | 4 | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [EVALUATE] |
| r/startup | 1M+ | 3 | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [EVALUATE] |
| r/SaaS | 80K+ | 3 | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [EVALUATE] |
| r/ecommerce | 150K+ | 4 | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [EVALUATE] |
| r/contentcreation | 50K+ | 4 | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [CHECK] | [EVALUATE] |

### Additional Candidates to Research

- r/Blogging -- content creators who need marketing prompts
- r/EmailMarketing -- direct relevance to the email prompt category
- r/PPC -- Google Ads and Facebook Ads prompt users
- r/SEO -- content marketers who could use the blog/landing page prompts
- r/sidehustle -- solopreneurs looking for efficiency tools
- r/WorkOnline -- remote workers and freelancers

## Template Process for New Subreddits

Follow this exact sequence for every new subreddit. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Research (Day 0)

- [ ] Read the subreddit rules in full
- [ ] Read the top 20 posts of all time -- understand what resonates
- [ ] Read the top 20 posts of the past month -- understand current discussion
- [ ] Identify 7-10 common questions or pain points that ContentKit addresses
- [ ] Note the community tone (formal vs. casual, skeptical vs. open, technical vs. beginner)
- [ ] Check for any existing AI tool promotion and community reaction to it
- [ ] Confirm the subreddit meets 4 of 5 selection criteria (above)

### Step 2: Create Free Resource (Day 0)

- [ ] Write a niche-specific free resource tailored to that subreddit's audience
- [ ] Adapt an existing free-resource from another subreddit if the audience overlaps
- [ ] The resource must provide standalone value -- it should be useful even if they never buy ContentKit
- [ ] Include 3-5 sample prompts relevant to the subreddit's niche
- [ ] Host the resource on getcontentkit.com with UTM tracking
- [ ] Create the UTM link: `https://getcontentkit.com/#free-guide?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign={subreddit-name}`

### Step 3: Write Seed Comments (Day 0)

- [ ] Draft 7 seed comments, each responding to a common thread topic
- [ ] Each comment must be 150-300 words of genuine, helpful advice
- [ ] Zero mentions of ContentKit, AI prompts, or any product
- [ ] Match the subreddit's tone and vocabulary
- [ ] Save drafts in `marketing/reddit/{subreddit-name}/seed-comments.md`

### Step 4: Seed Comments -- 7 Days (Days 1-7)

- [ ] Post 1 seed comment per day in relevant active threads
- [ ] Reply to any responses within 24 hours
- [ ] Upvote and engage with other community members' posts
- [ ] Track each comment in the execution tracker
- [ ] Monitor karma accumulation -- aim for 50+ comment karma in the subreddit before Day 8

### Step 5: Resource Post (Day 8)

- [ ] Write the resource post (save in `marketing/reddit/{subreddit-name}/resource-post.md`)
- [ ] Post should lead with the value of the free resource, not a sales pitch
- [ ] Include the UTM-tagged link
- [ ] Respond to every comment on the resource post within 2 hours
- [ ] Track in the execution tracker

### Step 6: Monitor and Engage (Days 9-14)

- [ ] Continue engaging in the subreddit with 2-3 comments per week
- [ ] Reply to any new comments on the resource post
- [ ] Track metrics: post upvotes, comments, UTM clicks, signups, purchases

## Metrics Thresholds for Expansion Decisions

Use these thresholds to decide whether to invest more in a subreddit or move on.

### Invest More (Double Down)

A subreddit is worth ongoing investment if it hits ANY of these thresholds:

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Email signups from resource post | 10+ | Post a second resource in 2-3 weeks |
| Purchases attributed (UTM) | 2+ | Create a subreddit-specific content series |
| Resource post upvotes | 50+ | The community is receptive -- become a regular contributor |
| Seed comment total karma | 100+ | Your voice resonates -- post more frequently |

### Maintain (Keep Light Presence)

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Email signups | 3-9 | Continue with 1-2 comments/week, no additional resource posts |
| Purchases | 1 | Maintain presence but don't invest more time |
| Resource post upvotes | 10-49 | Decent reception -- keep commenting but don't push more resources |

### Abandon (Move On)

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Email signups | 0-2 after 2 weeks | Stop investing time in this subreddit |
| Resource post upvotes | <10 | Community is not responsive to this type of content |
| Seed comments consistently at 0-1 upvotes | After 7 comments | Your content is not resonating -- wrong audience fit |
| Resource post removed by mods | -- | Immediate stop -- review rules, do not re-post |

---

## Scaling Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Subreddits | Total Active |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Batch 1 | Weeks 1-2 | r/freelance, r/smallbusiness, r/marketing, r/entrepreneur | 4 |
| Batch 2 | Weeks 2-3 | r/sales, r/realtors, r/accounting, r/copywriting | 8 |
| Evaluate | Week 4 | Review metrics from all 8 subreddits | 8 |
| Batch 3 | Weeks 5-6 | Top 2-3 expansion targets based on evaluation | 10-11 |
| Ongoing | Week 7+ | Maintain top performers, prune underperformers | 6-8 active |

**Target steady state:** 6-8 active subreddits with weekly engagement, producing 10+ email signups per week combined.

---

## Time Budget

| Activity | Time per subreddit per week | Notes |
|----------|---------------------------|-------|
| Research (initial only) | 1 hour | One-time investment |
| Writing seed comments | 30 min/day x 7 days = 3.5 hours | Front-loaded in Week 1 |
| Writing resource post | 1 hour | One-time per subreddit |
| Ongoing engagement | 30 min/week | After initial seed phase |
| Metrics tracking | 15 min/week | Update execution tracker |

**Maximum concurrent subreddits during seeding phase:** 4 (to maintain quality and avoid burnout)
**Maximum concurrent subreddits during maintenance phase:** 8-10
