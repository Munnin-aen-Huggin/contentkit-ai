**Title:** I made a free prompt guide for accounting firms who want more clients but don't have a marketing budget

**Body:**

I've spent a lot of time working on AI-powered marketing tools, and one group that consistently gets overlooked is accounting firms. You're excellent at the work, but most firms rely almost entirely on referrals for growth -- and when referrals slow down, there's no system to replace them.

The problem usually isn't that firms don't want to do marketing. It's that nobody in the firm has time to write blog posts, optimize Google listings, run ads, and maintain a LinkedIn presence on top of actual client work. And hiring a marketing agency at $3-5K/month feels hard to justify when you're not sure what the ROI looks like.

So I put together a free guide with 10 structured AI prompts built for accounting firm marketing. These aren't generic prompts -- each one is designed for a specific marketing task with frameworks, word counts, and variables you customize for your firm and market.

Here's what's inside:

- **Local SEO** -- location-targeted website copy and Google Business Profile descriptions that rank for "[service] in [city]" searches
- **Blog content** -- SEO outlines and listicle templates for tax season topics, deduction guides, and business formation content
- **Email newsletters** -- a weekly tip format that keeps clients and prospects engaged year-round
- **LinkedIn authority posts** -- thought leadership and trend commentary templates that attract referral partners and business owner clients
- **Google Ads** -- responsive search ad headlines and keyword-matched ad copy for your service areas
- **Referral emails** -- a natural, non-awkward template for asking satisfied clients to refer
- **Business listings** -- consistent citation copy for Google, Yelp, and professional directories

Each prompt works with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Copy, paste, fill in the variables for your firm, and get professional marketing copy in minutes.

No email gate, no signup. If any of these are useful for your firm, I'd genuinely like to hear about it. Happy to answer questions.
