**Thread title:** "How do you get new clients beyond word of mouth? Our firm's growth has plateaued."

**Comment:**

Word of mouth is great until it isn't -- you can't control the volume or timing. The firms I've seen break through the plateau all added one specific thing: content that ranks on Google for the searches their ideal clients are already making.

Think about it -- when a business owner searches "do I need a CPA for my LLC" or "small business tax deductions I'm missing," that's a person with a problem actively looking for someone who knows the answer. If your firm's blog post is the one they find, you're already positioned as the expert before they ever call.

You don't need to publish weekly. One well-researched, keyword-targeted blog post per month -- focused on a specific question your ideal client would search -- compounds over time. After 12 months, you've got 12 pages ranking and driving leads while you sleep.

Pair that with a Google Business Profile that's fully optimized with real photos, consistent NAP info, and regular review responses, and you've got a lead engine that doesn't depend on someone happening to mention your name at a dinner party. The firms growing fastest right now are treating their website like a second office, not a brochure.

**Thread title:** "Tax season is coming -- how do you handle the communication overload with clients?"

**Comment:**

The communication bottleneck during tax season usually isn't volume -- it's repetition. You're answering the same 15 questions hundreds of times. The fix that saved my sanity was creating a structured onboarding sequence that answers questions before clients ask them.

I set up a simple email sequence that goes out automatically when a client starts their engagement: email 1 is the document checklist with exact file names and formats, email 2 (3 days later) covers the 5 most common questions with clear answers, email 3 (day 7) is a status update template.

The result: client emails dropped by roughly 40% during filing season because people had the information before they needed to ask. The clients who did email had specific, answerable questions instead of "where are we at?"

The other thing that helped: setting clear response time expectations upfront. "We respond to all emails within one business day during filing season" eliminates the anxiety that drives people to follow up three times. Most client frustration isn't about speed -- it's about uncertainty. Remove the uncertainty and the inbox calms down significantly.

**Thread title:** "Should accounting firms be on LinkedIn? Feels like it's mostly recruiters and motivational posts."

**Comment:**

LinkedIn is probably the single best marketing channel for accounting firms, specifically because most firms ignore it. The bar is low and the audience is exactly right -- business owners, CFOs, attorneys, and financial advisors are all there.

The key is not posting generic firm updates like "Congratulations to our team on another great tax season." Nobody engages with that. What works is sharing specific, useful insights that your audience can apply. A post like "One tax planning move that saves most restaurant owners $5-10K -- and why October is the deadline to do it" will outperform any firm announcement.

Three posts per month is enough. One educational tip (a specific, actionable insight), one trend commentary (your take on a regulatory change or industry development), and one client success story (anonymized, focused on the outcome and what made it possible). That cadence builds authority without feeling like a full-time content job.

The attorneys and financial advisors in your network notice this content too. I've gotten more referral partnerships from LinkedIn posts than from any networking event. You're demonstrating expertise publicly, which makes it easy for them to refer clients your way with confidence.
